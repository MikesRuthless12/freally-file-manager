//! Error type surfaced by the Phase 27 chunk store.
//!
//! The crate uses one `thiserror` enum so callers (the engine copy
//! loop, the Tauri IPC shim, the smoke test) can pattern-match on the
//! variant and react accordingly — a corrupt pack is a hard "discard
//! and fall back to full copy", a missing chunk entry is a
//! "re-upload", an I/O error on put is usually a disk-full that
//! surfaces through the normal copy error path.
