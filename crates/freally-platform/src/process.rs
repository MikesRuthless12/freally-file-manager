//! Phase 44.3a — Process-control helpers.
//!
//! Houses the `unsafe` corner needed to keep `freally-secure-delete`
//! `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`-clean. Today it ships one helper:
//! [`linux_make_child_undumpable`], which closes the Phase 44.2
//! SECURITY MEDIUM finding (PSID argv leak via `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`)
//! by instructing a child process to mark itself non-dumpable
//! before `execve`.
//!
//! `prctl(PR_SET_DUMPABLE, 0)` makes the calling process's
//! `/proc/<pid>/{cmdline, environ, maps, ...}` non-readable to other
//! UIDs. The same UID can still read them; root can always read
//! everything. The threat model Phase 44.2 worried about
//! (unprivileged local attacker on a multi-user system racing
//! `cat /proc/*/cmdline` to capture an OPAL PSID) is closed by
//! this — the attacker's UID differs from the operator's.
