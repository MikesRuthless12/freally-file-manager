//! Phase 31b — user-presence probe.
//!
//! Wraps Windows's `SHQueryUserNotificationState` in a safe Rust
//! API the (unsafe-forbidden) `freally-power` crate can call. The
//! API answers two questions the power policy needs:
//!
//! - **`is_in_presentation_mode()`** — the user has explicitly
//!   asked the OS to suppress notifications (slideshow / focus
//!   assist / Do-Not-Disturb). The power policy pauses long copies
//!   here so the engine's I/O doesn't interrupt a presentation.
//! - **`is_in_fullscreen_mode()`** — Direct3D fullscreen specifically
//!   (games, fullscreen video). A *distinct* signal from presentation
//!   (a different `QUNS_*` state), so a fullscreen game/video drives
//!   the fullscreen rule, not the presentation rule.
//!
//! Linux + macOS + every other target return `false` here; the
//! Linux DBus screensaver query and the macOS `IOPMAssertion`
//! reads live in `freally-power` directly because they don't
//! need unsafe FFI.
