//! Shared verification abstraction.
//!
//! The `Hasher` trait and `Verifier` factory type live here so the copy
//! engine can drive verify-on-copy without depending on `freally-hash`.
//! `freally-hash` supplies the actual algorithm implementations and a
//! convenience `HashAlgorithm::verifier()` factory.
//!
//! # Lifecycle
//!
//! - On the source side the engine reuses the bytes it's already
//!   reading (`hasher.update(buf)` inside the `fill_buf` / `write_all`
//!   loop) so there's no re-read.
//! - On the destination side the engine opens the freshly-written file
//!   in a post-pass and hashes it independently. Two separate hasher
//!   instances, one comparison at the end.
//!
//! A mismatch produces a `CopyEvent::VerifyFailed` and fails the copy
//! with `CopyErrorKind::VerifyFailed`. Partial-destination cleanup
//! follows the same rules as every other failure path.
