//! Phase 42 Part B — per-file rolling versions: policy types + the
//! pure retention-pruning function the engine + UI consult before
//! deleting an old `versions` row.
//!
//! The actual snapshot-on-overwrite hook (engine-side wiring that
//! captures the about-to-be-overwritten file as a chunk-store
//! manifest before the new bytes land) is deferred to a follow-up
//! commit because it touches the copy loop's hot path. This module
//! ships the data model + decision logic so the
//! `freally-history::versions` table + the Settings → Versions
//! panel + Tauri command can build against a stable contract today.
//!
//! # Types
//!
//! - [`VersioningPolicy`] — per-job knob set: `enabled` flips the
//!   feature on/off, `retention` decides which versions survive.
//! - [`RetentionPolicy`] — variant set: `None` (keep every version
//!   forever — disk-bomb risk), `LastN(u32)` (keep the N newest),
//!   `OlderThanDays(u32)` (drop versions older than the cutoff), or
//!   `Gfs(GfsPolicy)` (Grandfather-Father-Son: keep the newest N per
//!   hour / day / week / month).
//! - [`GfsPolicy`] — the four GFS bucket counts.
//! - [`VersionEntry`] — minimal `(row_id, ts_ms)` shape the pure
//!   retention function consumes. Decoupled from
//!   `freally-history::VersionRecord` on purpose so this crate
//!   stays history-free.
//!
//! # Pure pruning
//!
//! [`select_for_pruning`] takes a slice of [`VersionEntry`] (the
//! current versions for one path, in any order) plus a
//! [`RetentionPolicy`] plus the current wall-clock in ms, and
//! returns the row ids the caller should delete. Callers are
//! expected to feed the result into
//! `History::delete_versions(...)`. The function is
//! deterministic + side-effect-free; the engine's copy hot path
//! never calls it.
