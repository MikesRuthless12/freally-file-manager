//! Phase 44.1e + 44.2e — Windows [`SanitizeHelper`] impl.
//!
//! **Stub through Phase 44.2.** The full Windows path requires
//! `DeviceIoControl(IOCTL_STORAGE_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_OUT)` calls
//! against the TCG OPAL command set, which is a few hundred lines
//! of unsafe FFI per command + careful data-structure marshaling
//! (`STORAGE_PROTOCOL_DATA_DESCRIPTOR`, the OPAL-specific
//! `Subsystem Class Driver` SECURITY-protocol headers, the SCSI
//! command DBLs). Per the workspace's "unsafe lives only in
//! `freally-platform`" invariant, that work belongs in a new
//! `freally-platform::sanitize` module.
//!
//! Phase 44.2 explicitly defers this to Phase 44.3 because:
//! 1. Hardware-validation cost. The OPAL command sequence
//!    (StartSession on Admin SP → RevertSP → CloseSession)
//!    requires a real Self-Encrypting Drive on a Windows test bed
//!    to verify. Shipping untested destructive code against
//!    arbitrary user drives is the wrong tradeoff.
//! 2. The capability probe via
//!    `IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY(StorageDeviceTrimProperty)`
//!    is testable on any Windows machine and would be a
//!    reasonable Phase 44.2 deliverable, but it's load-bearing
//!    only as input to the destructive paths — without those, the
//!    probe alone has no UI consumer.
//!
//! Phase 44.3 will land the full impl: capability probe, OPAL
//! crypto-erase via `IOCTL_STORAGE_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_OUT`, and
//! ATA Secure Erase via `ATA_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT`. The trait
//! contract this stub implements is stable; only the function
//! bodies change.
