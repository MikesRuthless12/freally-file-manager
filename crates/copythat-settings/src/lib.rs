//! `copythat-settings` — persistent user preferences + named profiles.
//!
//! Settings live in `settings.toml` at the OS config dir
//! (`%APPDATA%\CopyThat2026` / `~/Library/Application Support/CopyThat2026` /
//! `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/copythat`) and are round-trippable via `serde`.
//! Every field uses `#[serde(default)]` so forward-compatibility is
//! free: an older `settings.toml` missing a field gets the default
//! on load; a newer binary writing a field that an older binary
//! doesn't know about just ignores the unknown keys.
//!
//! Profiles are named snapshots of `Settings`: the user saves a
//! current config as "Archive verify" or "Fast local" and flips
//! between them without touching individual knobs. Each profile is
//! one JSON file under `settings-profiles/` — JSON because users are
//! expected to share / commit / diff these, and TOML's lack of
//! a canonical stable ordering makes JSON the nicer portable format
//! despite TOML being the preferred main-file format.
//!
//! The crate intentionally does NOT depend on `copythat-core` or
//! `copythat-hash` — it's a pure preference + IO layer. The Tauri
//! shell translates the enum variants here to the engine types at
//! enqueue time. Keeping the split means the engine stays free of
//! UI-layer concerns (theme, telemetry flag, intercept-default-copy)
//! and this crate stays free of heavyweight engine dependencies.
