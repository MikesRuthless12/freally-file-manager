//! Phase 46.4 — capability gating.
//!
//! Plugins declare the host resources they need in their
//! `plugin.toml` manifest. The user (Settings UI in 46.6) grants or
//! denies each capability. The host turns the granted set into a
//! [`CapabilityGrant`] and hands it to every
//! [`crate::PluginHandle::call_hook`] dispatch. If the manifest
//! declares a capability the grant does not contain, dispatch
//! rejects the call with [`crate::PluginError::CapabilityDenied`]
//! before the WASM instance is even built — "Plugins that ask for
//! capabilities the user denies still load but their hooks can't
//! perform the gated operation" (the load succeeds; only `call_hook`
//! refuses).
//!
//! 46.4 only carries the *declarative* layer: the types, the
//! manifest grammar, and the pre-call gate. Wiring `wasmtime-wasi`
//! preview1 imports against the granted capabilities — preopened
//! dirs for `read_fs:<scope>` / `write_fs:<scope>` and a
//! socket-allowlist for `network` — lands in 46.5 alongside the
//! sample plugins that actually import those functions.
