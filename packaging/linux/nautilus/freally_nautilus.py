# Freally File Manager v1.0.0 — Nautilus extension.
#
# Adds "Copy with Freally File Manager" and "Move with Freally File Manager" entries to the
# right-click menu on selected files and folders in GNOME Files
# (Nautilus 3.30+). Phase 7a ships this as a skeleton resource; the
# packaging step (Phase 16, deb/rpm/AppImage postinst) drops it into
# /usr/share/nautilus-python/extensions/ (system-wide) or
# ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions/ (per-user).
#
# Runtime requirements on the target system:
#   - python3-nautilus (>= 3.30, provides the `Nautilus` typelib)
#   - python3-gi (GObject bindings)
#   - `freally` binary in PATH (resolved lazily at click time)
#
# Licence: proprietary (same as the rest of this repo), source-visible.
