//! Phase 31 — runner-level power subscriber.
//!
//! Maps `copythat_power::PowerEvent`s received on the AppState's
//! `PowerBus` into `pause_all` / `resume_all` / `shape.set_rate`
//! directives, using the user's `PowerPoliciesSettings` as the
//! policy layer.
//!
//! The subscriber maintains just enough bookkeeping to unpause / un-
//! cap cleanly: it remembers whether the current pause/cap was
//! *power-owned* so a later `Continue` doesn't step on a user-
//! initiated pause. If the user manually paused via `pause_all`
//! while the bus was also pausing, the manual pause wins on resume.
