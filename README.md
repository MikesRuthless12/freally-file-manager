# Copy That v1.25.0

A lightweight, cross-platform, async, byte-exact file/folder copier in Rust —
matching every feature of TeraCopy and pushing past it, while staying as fast
as (or faster than) Explorer / Finder / `cp` / `rsync` for typical desktop
workloads.

## Features

### Copy engine

- **Byte-exact async copy** with selectable verification (CRC32, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512, xxHash3-64, xxHash3-128, BLAKE3).
- **OS-native fast paths** dispatched per platform: `CopyFileExW` (Windows, with `COPY_FILE_NO_BUFFERING` for files ≥ 256 MiB), `copyfile(3)` with `COPYFILE_ALL` (macOS), `copy_file_range(2)` + `sendfile(2)` fallback (Linux).
- **Reflink clones** on supported filesystems (Btrfs, XFS with reflink, ZFS, bcachefs, APFS, ReFS / Dev Drive) via `reflink-copy`, with a same-volume guard that skips the syscall on cross-volume copies.
- **Parallel multi-chunk** copy for large files (default 4 chunks at matched memory budget). Opt-in via `COPYTHAT_PARALLEL_CHUNKS`; see [`docs/BENCHMARKS.md`](docs/BENCHMARKS.md).
- **Dynamic buffer sizing** — 64 KiB → 4 MiB picked per file by `CopyOptions::buffer_size_for_file` from the Phase 13b sweep, which confirmed 1 MiB as the mid-band optimum.
- **Streaming tree enumeration** — walker feeds 100 k-entry `Plan` chunks through a bounded channel while copies run in parallel. **Tree size is bounded only by the destination volume, not by RAM** — drives with tens of millions of files work the same as ten-file folders.
- **Concurrency control** tuned per-destination with an HDD heuristic that clamps to a single worker on rotational media.

### Resilience

- **Locked-file copy on Windows** — opens the source with `FILE_SHARE_READ | WRITE | DELETE` plus an exponential-backoff retry on `ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION`, so in-use log files, loaded DLLs, and Office documents copy without admin.
- **Symlink preserve + graceful degrade** — clones symlinks when the process has privilege (or Windows Developer Mode is on); falls back to copying the target contents as a regular file so nothing is lost.
- **Access-denied tolerance** — `$RECYCLE.BIN\S-1-5-*`, `System Volume Information`, `Config.Msi`, etc. are skipped and counted, not fatal.
- **Collision policy** picked up-front in the drop dialog: *Keep both* (`foo.txt` → `foo_2.txt`, `foo_3.txt`, …), *Skip*, *Overwrite*, *Overwrite only if newer*, *Ask each time*.
- **Error policy** per-job: *Ask*, *Skip*, *Abort*, or *Retry N times*.
- **Error prompt style** — blocking modal or non-blocking corner drawer; user-configurable in Settings → General.
- **Pause / resume / cancel** on every job, plus pause-all / resume-all / cancel-all.
- **Reserve free space on destination** — optional minimum, preflight-warned before the first byte moves.
- **Enumeration-time filters** — include / exclude globs (`**/*.txt`, `**/node_modules`), size range, modification-time range, and attribute bits (hidden, system, read-only) are applied inside the walker so the engine never even opens the files you didn't want. Exclude globs that match a directory prune the whole subtree; include globs gate files only, so a `**/*.txt` filter still descends every folder to find the text files inside. Configured per-install under Settings → Filters.

### Interface

- **Tauri 2.x + Svelte 5** single-window shell; dense default theme, light / dark / system.
- **Activity panel** with one row per file the engine touches: live circular ring, `src → dst` truncated, `bytes_done / total`, and icons for pending / in-flight / done / error / folder. Caps at 250 000 rows for stable performance on 4 GB systems.
- **Sort + reorder** the pre-copy source list by name or size, asc or desc, with `Home` / `End` / `Ctrl+↑↓` / `Shift+↑↓` keyboard shortcuts.
- **Files-first grouping** — sorts always put files ahead of folders, enforced even through manual drag-reorders.
- **Preflight free-space check** with a subset-picker modal when the full set won't fit.
- **History** (SQLite): every job logs kind, source, destination, verify algorithm, size, status, duration; filter by kind / status / text; export CSV; clear-all with two-step confirm; **Rerun** any past job with one click.
- **Lifetime Totals drawer** — bytes, files, jobs, errors, by-kind breakdown, 30-day sparkline.
- **Per-file live counter**, verbose compact ETA (`3h 10m 38s`), average MiB/s — header never says "calculating…" when idle.
- **When-done action** — keep app open, close app, log off, shut down, sleep.
- **System tray** with minimize-to-tray-on-close option.
- **Drag-and-drop and picker** entry points: drag onto the window, or use *Add files* / *Add folders* in the header.
- **Shell integration** — Windows IExplorerCommand, macOS Finder Sync, Linux `.desktop` / KDE ServiceMenu / Thunar UCA all route into the same queue via `copythat --enqueue <verb> <paths…> [--destination <dst>]`.
- **Global paste hotkey** — press Ctrl+Shift+V (Windows / Linux) or Cmd+Shift+V (macOS) anywhere on the system to paste files copied from Explorer / Finder / Files through Copy That's staging dialog. Combo is user-configurable; the shortcut can be toggled off entirely.
- **Clipboard watcher** (opt-in) — surfaces a toast when file URLs land on the OS clipboard, hinting the paste hotkey is ready. Polls every 500 ms while enabled; silent when off.
- **Secure delete** — single-pass zero / random, DoD 3-pass, DoD 7-pass, Gutmann 35-pass, NIST 800-88. SSD-aware (skips multi-pass overwrites on SSDs by default — use TRIM instead).
- **Read-through-snapshot for locked files** — when another process holds the source open for exclusive write, Copy That can pull a read-only filesystem snapshot (VSS on Windows, ZFS / Btrfs on Linux, APFS local snapshot on macOS) and copy from there instead of surfacing the "file in use" error. Opt-in via Settings → Transfer → "When a file is locked". The Windows path spawns a sibling `copythat-helper-vss.exe` via UAC so the main app never needs elevation of its own.
- **Crash / reboot resume** — every 50 ms the copy engine fsync's the destination and writes a checkpoint to a redb-backed journal at `<data-dir>/copythat-journal.redb` (carrying the running BLAKE3 of consumed source bytes). On the next launch Copy That detects unfinished jobs, BLAKE3-verifies the partial destination's prefix, and seeks both source and destination past the verified offset — power-cut at 96 % of a 2 TB transfer no longer means starting over. Toggle "Auto-resume interrupted jobs without prompting" in Settings → General to skip the resume modal.
- **Bandwidth shaping** — Settings → Network lets you cap transfers at a fixed MB/s, follow a daily rclone-style schedule (`08:00,512k 18:00,10M Sat-Sun,unlimited`), or react automatically to metered Wi-Fi / battery / cellular. Cap applies globally across every in-flight job; a minute-tick poller re-evaluates the schedule so a 09:00 boundary change hot-swaps the live rate without touching running jobs. Header badge (🔻 30 MB/s · scheduled) shows the active cap — click it to open the Network tab. GCRA token bucket via the `governor` crate is accurate to a handful of milliseconds across the full range (1 KB/s → storage-native ceiling).
- **Sparse file preservation** — a 100 GB VM disk with 1 MB of real data stays 1 MB on disk at the destination. Copy That detects allocated extents via `SEEK_HOLE` / `SEEK_DATA` on Linux / macOS and `FSCTL_QUERY_ALLOCATED_RANGES` on Windows, marks the destination sparse (NTFS `FSCTL_SET_SPARSE`; automatic on APFS / ext4 / Btrfs / XFS / ZFS / ReFS), and seeks-copies only the allocated ranges so holes are preserved by omission. Toggle in Settings → Transfer → *Preserve sparse files* (default on); destinations that can't preserve sparseness (exFAT / FAT32 / HFS+) raise a one-shot "destination fills sparse files" toast and densify.
- **Security metadata preservation** — out-of-band metadata streams round-trip across every copy: Windows NTFS Alternate Data Streams (including the **Mark-of-the-Web** `Zone.Identifier` that SmartScreen and Office Protected View key off — a downloaded `.exe` keeps its origin warning after the copy), Linux extended attributes + POSIX ACLs + SELinux contexts + file capabilities (`security.capability`), macOS xattrs (Gatekeeper `com.apple.quarantine`, Spotlight `kMDItemWhereFroms`, Finder color tags) + the legacy resource fork at `<file>/..namedfork/rsrc`. Cross-FS destinations that can't hold the foreign metadata (SMB / FAT / exFAT / ext4 receiving Mac data) automatically fall through to an `._<filename>` AppleDouble v2 sidecar so the data survives the trip. Settings → Transfer → "Security metadata" gives per-stream toggles; the MOTW toggle carries an explicit security warning since disabling it lets a downloaded executable shed its origin marker on copy.
- **Two-way sync with conflict detection** — configure a sync pair (two folders on any filesystem) and Copy That reconciles them without silent overwrites. Per-file vector clocks persisted in `<left>/.copythat-sync.db` (redb) detect three cases: one side is an ancestor of the other (propagate), both diverged concurrently from a common ancestor (conflict), or vectors match but content diverged (corrupt). Concurrent edits are never auto-resolved destructively — the losing side's content is preserved in place as `name.sync-conflict-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<host>.ext`, and both versions surface in the Sync drawer for per-file resolution (Keep left / Keep right / Keep both). Four modes: two-way, mirror (either direction), and contribute (one-way upload that never deletes on the receiver). Moves model as delete+add until the three-tree state machine lands in Phase 52.
- **Real-time mirror (live sync)** — toggle "Start live mirror" on any sync pair and Copy That watches the left-side folder (ReadDirectoryChangesW on Windows, FSEvents on macOS, inotify on Linux) and re-syncs on every debounced change. Edge cases that normally produce spurious sync rounds — vim's `:wq` dance (5 inotify events, 1 logical save), Word's `~$lock` + temp-rename dance, atomic writes like `write-to-tmp → fsync → rename-over` — all collapse to a single `Modified(file.ext)` event by the watcher's filter + atomic-save tracker + priority-ordered debounce queue (Removed > Renamed > Modified > Created). Windows ReadDirectoryChangesW buffer overflows trigger a recovery rescan so no change is silently dropped; macOS FSEvents directory-coalesce signals are resolved by synchronous enumeration. One background thread per active pair, surfaced in the UI as a green pulsing dot + "Watching" badge.

### Internationalisation

- **18 languages** shipped in full: Arabic, Chinese (Simplified), Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Spanish, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese.
- **Fluent**-based (`.ftl`) key system with `xtask i18n-lint` enforcing key parity + syntax.
- **RTL support** (Arabic) with `dir="rtl"` on the root and icon mirroring.
- **Locale-driven formatting**: `Intl.NumberFormat` for bytes / percent / counts, `Intl.DisplayNames` for language pickers (each language renders in its own endonym + in the active UI locale).
- **Reactive translation switching** — changes apply instantly across every modal, drawer, and badge without reload.

### Cloud backends (Phase 32)

- **12 backends via OpenDAL + one custom SFTP path**: Amazon S3, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage, OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, WebDAV, FTP, LocalFs — plus SFTP via a pure-Rust MIT-licensed `russh` / `russh-sftp` backend (avoids OpenDAL's GPL-blocked `services-sftp`).
- **Settings → Remotes tab** for add / remove / test-connection; secrets live in the OS keychain (Apple Keychain / Windows Credential Manager / Secret Service / kwallet) under `copythat-cloud/<backend-name>`, never in `settings.toml`.
- **Engine-level cloud destinations**: `copy_file` routes through `CopyOptions::cloud_sink` when the destination is remote, streaming the source in `buffer_size` chunks through `opendal::Operator::writer()` with multipart upload handled transparently (S3-class backends). Progress events fire per-chunk with running byte counts.
- **Verify-on-remote** with four algorithms (BLAKE3, SHA-256, MD5, round-trip). The server-side checksum fast-path (ETag on S3-class, `content-md5` on Azure Blob) skips the round-trip fetch when the backend exposes a comparable hash.
- **OAuth device-code flow** for Microsoft Graph + Google Drive + Dropbox, plus an **RFC 7636 PKCE browser-redirect flow** for providers where device-code isn't available. Refresh-token flow preserves the old refresh_token when providers (MS Graph) omit it on refresh. Loopback HTTP receiver on `127.0.0.1:<auto-port>` catches the authorize redirect.
- **SFTP key forms**: password (default), unencrypted OpenSSH private key (`KEY\n<body>`), encrypted OpenSSH private key (`KEY_ENC\n<passphrase>\n<body>`). `known_hosts` pinning with both plain + hashed `|1|salt|hmac` entries (HMAC-SHA1 host matching). Connection pooling via an `Arc<AsyncMutex<PooledSession>>` so concurrent put / get calls reuse a live SSH channel and re-handshake lazily on error.
- **Resume journal awareness**: `JobRecord::remote_backend_name` distinguishes cloud-dst from local-dst at startup-resume time; cross-process MPU resume is intentionally not handled (Copy That's remote-destination model is idempotent re-copy).

### Mount the archive (Phase 33)

- **Cross-platform read-only mount** of the Copy That snapshot history: `by-date/YYYY-MM-DD/HH-MM-SS/<job>` + `by-source/<escaped-src-root>/<timestamp>` + `by-job-id/<row-id>/<job>`. The mount exposes historical copies as plain folders — `cat` / Explorer / Finder all work.
- **FUSE** on Linux/macOS behind `--features fuse` (pulls `fuser` 0.15, MIT). Real `fuser::Filesystem` trait impl with `lookup` / `getattr` / `readdir` / `read` consulting `TreeInodeMap` + the Phase 27 chunk store.
- **WinFsp** on Windows behind `--features winfsp` (pulls `winfsp_wrs` 0.4, MIT — replaces the GPL-blocked `winfsp-sys`). Real `winfsp_wrs::FileSystemInterface` impl overriding `get_volume_info`, `get_security_by_name`, `open`, `close`, `read`, `read_directory`, `get_file_info`. Default SDDL (`D:P(A;;GR;;;WD)`) grants everyone generic-read.
- **Chunk-streaming reads**: `read` callbacks walk each item's Phase 27 manifest by cursor, fetching only chunks that overlap `[offset, offset+size)` — multi-GB snapshots don't spike memory.
- **History context menu**: *Mount snapshot* on any successful history row opens a directory picker + dispatches the mount IPC; *Settings → Advanced* has a *Mount latest on launch* toggle.
- **USER ACTION** to validate real kernel mounts: run `cargo test -p copythat-mount --features fuse` on Linux/macOS, or `cargo test -p copythat-mount --features winfsp` on Windows (requires the WinFsp driver + LLVM libclang installed — see [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) Phase 33g for the exact `winget` commands).

### Enterprise audit log (Phase 34)

- **Eight typed events** — `JobStarted`, `JobCompleted`, `FileCopied`, `FileFailed`, `CollisionResolved`, `SettingsChanged`, `LoginEvent`, `UnauthorizedAccess` — are written into an append-only log sink every time the engine hits a user-visible transition.
- **Five wire formats** ship simultaneously: **CSV** (eight-column stable header for spreadsheet forensics), **JSON-lines** (default, pipe-friendly), **Syslog RFC 5424** (structured-data block `[copythat@32473 jobId="..." user="..."]`), **ArcSight CEF v0** (`CEF:0|CopyThat|CopyThat|<ver>|<sig>|<name>|<sev>|<ext>`), and **IBM QRadar LEEF 2.0** (tab-separated extension, `LEEF:2.0|CopyThat|CopyThat|<ver>|<eventID>|<ext>`).
- **Tamper-evident chain**: every record embeds `prev_hash = BLAKE3(previous_record_bytes)` as a hex column; one edit anywhere in the file cascades into every subsequent record's chain step. The Settings → *Verify chain* button + the Phase 36 CLI's `copythat audit verify <log>` catch single-byte tampering.
- **WORM (write-once-read-many)** is an opt-in Settings toggle that applies the platform's append-only primitive after every create / rotate: Linux `FS_IOC_SETFLAGS | FS_APPEND_FL` (requires CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE), macOS `chflags(UF_APPEND)`, Windows `FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READONLY` (the richer deny-write ACE path is a Phase 36 follow-up).
- **Rotation** rolls the log to `<path>.1` at a byte threshold (default 10 MiB, slider in Settings); the rollover re-applies the WORM attribute to the fresh file.
- **Tracing fan-out**: `tracing_subscriber::Layer` captures any `target = "copythat::audit"` log from the rest of the workspace into the sink so ad-hoc `warn!` calls auditors care about land in the same file.
- **Settings → Advanced → Audit log** surfaces the enable toggle, format picker, file path, rotation threshold, WORM toggle, and *Test write* + *Verify chain* buttons. The sink hot-swaps on every `update_settings` without restart.

### Encryption + on-the-fly compression (Phase 35)

- **Destination encryption via [age](https://age-encryption.org/)** — passphrase, X25519 (`age1…`), or SSH ed25519 / RSA recipients. Output is bit-for-bit compatible with the upstream `rage` CLI's binary format, so a future user can decrypt with the official `rage` binary without Copy That in the loop.
- **On-the-fly zstd compression** with three modes: *Off* (default), *Always* (every file at the chosen level), *Smart* (every file *except* a built-in 38-extension deny list covering jpg / mp4 / zip / 7z / pdf / msi / iso / etc. — re-compressing already-compressed media wastes CPU and can grow the file). User can append extra extensions to the Smart deny list.
- **zstd level 1–22 slider** in Settings → Transfer → Compression. Default is 3 (zstd's CLI default and the workspace's "fast + useful" pick); higher numbers compress harder at progressively-larger CPU cost.
- **Live compression metrics**: every file's `CopyEvent::CompressionSavings { ratio, bytes_saved }` event powers a footer "💾 256 MiB → 84 MiB (67% saved)" badge against the running tree totals.
- **Engine pipeline** (when either stage is active): `src bytes → optional zstd encoder → optional age encryptor → dst`. The pipeline runs on a `spawn_blocking` worker so age + zstd (both sync-first libraries) compose cleanly with the async copy engine. Fast paths + verify + sparse + chunk-store + journal are auto-bypassed because byte-level invariants don't hold against a transformed destination.
- **Decryption is symmetric**: `copythat_crypt::decrypted_reader` accepts a passphrase, X25519 secret key, or SSH private key — same `Identity` bag, same age-format input. The runner's auto-decrypt-on-copy-FROM-`.age` flow lands in a Phase 35 follow-up.
- **Settings → Transfer → Encryption + Compression** carries the mode pickers, recipients-file path, and the level slider. The passphrase modal flow (collect at copy-start, hold in `secrecy::SecretString` for the duration of the run) is deferred to a Phase 35 follow-up — today the runner falls back to plain copy when the user selects `passphrase` mode and logs the reason.

### Mobile companion (Phase 37)

- **PWA over PeerJS WebRTC.** The phone-side app at [`apps/copythat-mobile/`](apps/copythat-mobile/) is a Vite + Svelte 5 Progressive Web App. Users open the deployed URL in their phone browser, scan the desktop's pairing QR with the system camera, and tap "Add to Home Screen" — the manifest reuses the desktop's icon so the home-screen launcher matches the desktop tray. **No App Store gate.**
- **Pairing protocol.** Settings → Mobile shows a `cthat-pair://<peer-id>?sas=<base32-256-bit>` QR. The PWA scans it, opens a PeerJS data channel against the desktop's stable peer-id, and both sides derive the same four-emoji SAS short-authentication-string from `SHA-256(seed ‖ desktop_pubkey ‖ phone_pubkey)`. The user confirms the four glyphs match; pairing commits.
- **Always-on availability.** "Always connect to Mobile App" toggle (Settings → Mobile) registers the desktop's persisted peer-id with the PeerJS broker on every launch, so paired phones can connect anytime the desktop is running. Auto-connect requires at least one paired device — the runner shows the install QR + "pair a phone first" prompt instead of registering when no pairing exists.
- **Full remote control surface.** The PWA drives every active job (pause / resume / cancel), resolves collisions (overwrite / overwrite-all / skip / skip-all / rename / keep-both), kicks off saved profiles + history reruns, fires secure-delete jobs, and shows live globals (percentage to two decimals, files-done / files-total, rate, per-operation tally) plus a streaming "files being processed" panel that scrolls individual filenames as the desktop walks the tree.
- **Loading-state lock.** When the desktop is enumerating files (after a Re-run / Start Copy / etc.), all PWA control buttons disable until the desktop emits `JobReady` so the user can't fire conflicting commands during the load phase.
- **Keep desktop awake.** PWA toggle that asks the desktop to inhibit screensaver / sleep while the connection is live — `SetThreadExecutionState` on Windows, `IOPMAssertionCreateWithName` on macOS, `org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver.Inhibit` on Linux. The OS-level wake-lock glue lives in `copythat-platform` (Phase 37 follow-up); the IPC + setting are wired today.
- **Synchronized state.** Pause / cancel / resume that originates on the desktop UI flows back to the PWA via `JobStateChanged` streaming events; the inverse path uses standard request / `Ok` reply. Desktop exit emits `ServerShuttingDown` so the PWA shows an explicit "Desktop exited — reconnect when Copy That is running again" screen instead of a generic disconnect.
- **Push notifications.** APNs ES256 JWT + FCM RS256 JWT signers in `copythat_mobile::notify` for completion notifications when the data channel is asleep. Real provider-token signing is wired today; the runner reads the credentials out of the `MobileSettings` blob (the keychain migration lands in a Phase 37 follow-up).
- **Exit button.** Phone-side button cleanly disconnects PeerJS, sends `Goodbye`, and clears the in-memory session so a closed tab can't accidentally leak a control link.

### `copythat` CLI (Phase 36)

- **`copythat <SUBCOMMAND>`** — a real command-line interface suitable for CI/CD pipelines, automation scripts, and headless servers. Top-level commands: `copy`, `move`, `sync`, `shred`, `verify`, `history`, `stack`, `remote`, `mount`, `audit`, `plan`, `apply`, `version`, `config`, and `completions`.
- **Stable JSON-Lines output** via `--json` — one tagged JSON object per line on `stdout` with twelve canonical event kinds (`job_started` / `job_progress` / `job_completed` / `job_failed` / `plan_action` / `plan_summary` / `version` / `config_value` / `verify_ok` / `verify_failed` / `info` / `error`). Every line carries a UTC `ts` field, so `jq -r 'select(.kind=="job_progress")' < log.ndjson` pipes work out of the box.
- **Nine documented exit codes** — `0` success, `1` generic error, `2` pending actions (plan), `3` collisions unresolved, `4` verify failed, `5` network unreachable, `6` permission denied, `7` disk full, `8` user canceled, `9` config invalid. Surfaced as a `#[repr(u8)]` enum so the numeric values cannot drift between releases.
- **Declarative TOML jobspec** drives `plan` (no-mutation; reports the action list and exits 2 with pending) and `apply` (runs the same plan; idempotent — re-runs on a finished tree exit 0 with zero new actions). Spec layout: `[job] kind / source / destination / verify / shape / preserve / collisions`, plus `[retry]` and an optional `[schedule]`.
- **Shell completions** for bash / zsh / fish / pwsh / elvish via `copythat completions <SHELL>`. Redirect `stdout` to the shell's per-user completion location; the CLI itself never writes files.
- **Stub commands for cross-cutting features** (sync / shred / stack / remote / mount / audit) accept the same flag surface the GUI uses so scripts written today don't break when the wiring lands in a follow-up phase. Each stub exits `1` and emits a clearly-labelled `cli-info-stub-deferred` JSON event.

### Performance

- **Beats every measured competitor on Windows 11 NVMe** (10 GiB · same-volume copy):

  | Tool | MiB/s | vs CopyThat CLI |
  | --- | ---: | ---: |
  | **CopyThat CLI / engine** | **2429** | — |
  | **CopyThat UI (Phase 40)** | **2198** | −9 % |
  | Robocopy | 1305 | **−46 %** |
  | FastCopy | 1006 | **−59 %** |
  | cmd copy | 940-1147 | **−53-61 %** |
  | TeraCopy | 855 | **−65 %** |

  CopyThat's UI also beats every competitor by 68-157 % on the same workload. Caveat: cross-volume copies (C→D, C→E) are bound by the destination disk's write speed and tend to tie across all tools — engine speed only matters when the disk isn't the bottleneck.

- **`PlatformFastCopyHook` everywhere** — every entry point (CLI, UI start_copy, UI rerun, CLI shell-extension enqueue) attaches the hook so reflink + `CopyFileExW` + the Phase 38 dedup ladder are the default fast paths.
- **Phase 40 named-pipe broker** — `copythat-ui --enqueue` invocations forward argv to the running first instance via named pipe in **110 ms** instead of booting a fresh ~5 second Tauri runtime per call.
- **Phase 41 cross-volume auto-engage** — `is_cross_volume(src, dst)` automatically routes large cross-volume copies through the overlapped-IOCP pipeline with 8 in-flight × 4 MiB buffers + cached I/O (matches Robocopy's USB tuning).
- **1 MiB** is the measured optimum buffer size on the default `CopyFileExW` path; all other sizes regressed in the Phase 13b sweep — see [`docs/BENCHMARKS.md`](docs/BENCHMARKS.md).
- **Head-to-head methodology + per-scenario numbers** live in [`COMPETITOR-TEST.md`](COMPETITOR-TEST.md) at the repo root (256 MiB + 10 GiB workloads across same-volume, cross-NTFS, external-SSD destinations).
- **Cross-volume reflink guard** avoids a pointless syscall on copies that can't possibly reflink (different volume IDs).
- **Criterion benches** live at `crates/copythat-core/benches/copy_bench.rs`: `single_huge_file`, `buffer_size_sweep`, `many_small_files` (10 KiB / 100 KiB / 1 MiB / 10 MiB mix), `mixed_tree` (10 KiB → 250 MiB).
- **Power-user env-var tunables** documented in [`docs/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md`](docs/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md): `COPYTHAT_PARALLEL_CHUNKS`, `COPYTHAT_OVERLAPPED_IO`, `COPYTHAT_OVERLAPPED_BUFFER_KB`, `COPYTHAT_OVERLAPPED_SLOTS`, `COPYTHAT_OVERLAPPED_NO_BUFFERING`, `COPYTHAT_NO_BUFFERING_THRESHOLD_MB`, `COPYTHAT_SKIP_ZERO_FILL` (admin-only), `COPYTHAT_DISABLE_AUTO_OVERLAPPED`.
- **Research underpinnings** — every default backed by data: [`docs/RESEARCH_PHASE_39.md`](docs/RESEARCH_PHASE_39.md) (Win32 + NTFS internals + IoRing + DirectStorage + scatter/gather), [`docs/RESEARCH_PHASE_40.md`](docs/RESEARCH_PHASE_40.md) (UI-bypass + Win32-skip evaluation, hard-cap analysis).

## Building

Prerequisites:

- Rust toolchain (stable, ≥ 1.85). Install with [rustup](https://rustup.rs).
- Node.js 20+ and `pnpm` 9+. Install pnpm with `npm i -g pnpm` or via
  [`corepack`](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html).
- Platform Tauri prerequisites:
  [docs.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/).

Workspace build:

```sh
cargo build --all
```

Tauri debug build:

```sh
cd apps/copythat-ui
pnpm install
pnpm tauri build --debug
```

Release build (no installer bundle):

```sh
cd apps/copythat-ui
pnpm tauri build --no-bundle
```

Lint Fluent key parity across all 18 locales:

```sh
cargo run -p xtask -- i18n-lint
```

Run Criterion benches:

```sh
# Full-size run; several minutes on a normal SSD
cargo bench -p copythat-core --bench copy_bench

# CI-scaled run, finishes in ~60 s
cargo run -p xtask --release -- bench-ci

# Head-to-head against any competitor copiers on PATH
cargo run -p xtask --release -- bench-vs
```

Per-phase smoke tests (run them individually):

```sh
# Phase 0 — scaffold
bash tests/smoke/phase_00_scaffold.sh

# Phase 1 — 100 MiB async round-trip through copy_file
cargo test -p copythat-core --test phase_01_core_copy -- --nocapture

# Phase 2 — 500-file tree copy + move
cargo test -p copythat-core --test phase_02_tree_queue -- --nocapture

# Phase 3 — 500 MiB copy+verify across all 8 hash algorithms
cargo test -p copythat-hash --test phase_03_verify --release -- --nocapture

# Phase 4 — 10 MiB shred across every ShredMethod
cargo test -p copythat-secure-delete --test phase_04_shred -- --nocapture

# Phase 5 — Tauri shell end-to-end
pwsh tests/smoke/phase_05_ui.ps1     # Windows
bash tests/smoke/phase_05_ui.sh      # macOS / Linux

# Phase 6 — sparse-file round-trip through the platform fast paths
cargo test -p copythat-platform --test phase_06_fast_paths -- --nocapture

# Phase 13 — throughput floor (20 MiB/s on a 100 MiB single-file copy)
cargo test -p copythat-ui --test phase_13_bench -- --nocapture

# Phase 16 — free-first packaging tripwire (no paid signing, free runners only)
cargo test -p copythat-ui --test phase_16_package -- --nocapture

# Phase 17a — red-team `..` traversal rejection at every trust boundary
cargo test -p copythat-core --test phase_17_security -- --nocapture

# Phase 18 — end-to-end: seed → copy_tree(BLAKE3) → history → CSV → shred_tree
cargo test -p copythat-ui --test phase_18_e2e -- --nocapture
# Scale up the phase 18 run to the literal Phase 18 brief (10 000 files):
COPYTHAT_PHASE18_FULL=1 cargo test -p copythat-ui --test phase_18_e2e --release

# Phase 23 — 100 MiB sparse copy: byte-exact + dst allocated <= 8 MiB
cargo test -p copythat-platform --test phase_23_sparse -- --nocapture
```

## Installing

Installable artifacts for every supported platform are produced by a
tag-triggered workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) that runs
exclusively on free GitHub-hosted runners. Tag a commit with `v*.*.*`
and the release job uploads:

| Platform | Artifact                    | Install command / channel                                    |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Windows  | MSI + NSIS (`.exe`)          | Double-click, or `winget install CopyThat.CopyThat` (after the winget-pkgs PR merges) |
| macOS    | `.app` + `.dmg` (x64 + arm64)| Right-click → Open on first launch, or `brew install --cask copythat` |
| Linux    | AppImage + `.deb` + `.rpm`   | `sudo apt install ./copythat-ui_<ver>_amd64.deb`, or Flathub / AUR |

Everything above ships **without paying for code-signing**:

- Windows installers are unsigned. SmartScreen shows a one-time
  warning for the first ~100 downloads, then Microsoft's reputation
  service clears the binary. Winget's SHA-256 verification gives a
  tamper-proof install path in the meantime.
- macOS bundles are **ad-hoc signed** (`codesign -s -`). Gatekeeper
  asks you to right-click → Open on first launch; subsequent launches
  are silent. Homebrew cask auto-clears the quarantine flag.
- Linux artifacts are GPG-signed only if the maintainers have set the
  optional `GPG_SIGNING_KEY` repository secret; otherwise they ship
  unsigned and distros verify via the AppImage hash + apt/rpm trust.

The free-first guarantee is enforced by
[`tests/smoke/phase_16_package.rs`](tests/smoke/phase_16_package.rs),
which fails the build if the release workflow ever imports a
paid-signing service outside a commented-out upgrade block. The paid
upgrade paths (Azure Trusted Signing ~$10/mo, Apple Developer $99/yr,
MiniSign updater signing) are captured in a maintainer-local
`docs/SIGNING_UPGRADE.md` planning doc; the commented-out
`windows-sign:` and `macos-notarize:` job blocks at the bottom of
`.github/workflows/release.yml` mirror the exact wiring.
