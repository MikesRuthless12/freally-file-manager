# Copy That v0.19.84

A lightweight, cross-platform, async, byte-exact file/folder copier in Rust —
matching every feature of TeraCopy and pushing past it, while staying as fast
as (or faster than) Explorer / Finder / `cp` / `rsync` for typical desktop
workloads.

## Features

### Copy engine

- **Byte-exact async copy** with selectable verification (CRC32, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512, xxHash3-64, xxHash3-128, BLAKE3).
- **OS-native fast paths** dispatched per platform: `CopyFileExW` (Windows, with `COPY_FILE_NO_BUFFERING` for files ≥ 256 MiB), `copyfile(3)` with `COPYFILE_ALL` (macOS), `copy_file_range(2)` + `sendfile(2)` fallback (Linux).
- **Reflink clones** on supported filesystems (Btrfs, XFS with reflink, ZFS, bcachefs, APFS, ReFS / Dev Drive) via `reflink-copy`, with a same-volume guard that skips the syscall on cross-volume copies.
- **Parallel multi-chunk** copy for large files (default 4 chunks at matched memory budget). Opt-in via `COPYTHAT_PARALLEL_CHUNKS`; see [`docs/BENCHMARKS.md`](docs/BENCHMARKS.md).
- **Dynamic buffer sizing** — 64 KiB → 4 MiB picked per file by `CopyOptions::buffer_size_for_file` from the Phase 13b sweep, which confirmed 1 MiB as the mid-band optimum.
- **Streaming tree enumeration** — walker feeds 100 k-entry `Plan` chunks through a bounded channel while copies run in parallel. **Tree size is bounded only by the destination volume, not by RAM** — drives with tens of millions of files work the same as ten-file folders.
- **Concurrency control** tuned per-destination with an HDD heuristic that clamps to a single worker on rotational media.

### Resilience

- **Locked-file copy on Windows** — opens the source with `FILE_SHARE_READ | WRITE | DELETE` plus an exponential-backoff retry on `ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION`, so in-use log files, loaded DLLs, and Office documents copy without admin.
- **Symlink preserve + graceful degrade** — clones symlinks when the process has privilege (or Windows Developer Mode is on); falls back to copying the target contents as a regular file so nothing is lost.
- **Access-denied tolerance** — `$RECYCLE.BIN\S-1-5-*`, `System Volume Information`, `Config.Msi`, etc. are skipped and counted, not fatal.
- **Collision policy** picked up-front in the drop dialog: *Keep both* (`foo.txt` → `foo_2.txt`, `foo_3.txt`, …), *Skip*, *Overwrite*, *Overwrite only if newer*, *Ask each time*.
- **Error policy** per-job: *Ask*, *Skip*, *Abort*, or *Retry N times*.
- **Error prompt style** — blocking modal or non-blocking corner drawer; user-configurable in Settings → General.
- **Pause / resume / cancel** on every job, plus pause-all / resume-all / cancel-all.
- **Reserve free space on destination** — optional minimum, preflight-warned before the first byte moves.
- **Enumeration-time filters** — include / exclude globs (`**/*.txt`, `**/node_modules`), size range, modification-time range, and attribute bits (hidden, system, read-only) are applied inside the walker so the engine never even opens the files you didn't want. Exclude globs that match a directory prune the whole subtree; include globs gate files only, so a `**/*.txt` filter still descends every folder to find the text files inside. Configured per-install under Settings → Filters.

### Interface

- **Tauri 2.x + Svelte 5** single-window shell; dense default theme, light / dark / system.
- **Activity panel** with one row per file the engine touches: live circular ring, `src → dst` truncated, `bytes_done / total`, and icons for pending / in-flight / done / error / folder. Caps at 250 000 rows for stable performance on 4 GB systems.
- **Sort + reorder** the pre-copy source list by name or size, asc or desc, with `Home` / `End` / `Ctrl+↑↓` / `Shift+↑↓` keyboard shortcuts.
- **Files-first grouping** — sorts always put files ahead of folders, enforced even through manual drag-reorders.
- **Preflight free-space check** with a subset-picker modal when the full set won't fit.
- **History** (SQLite): every job logs kind, source, destination, verify algorithm, size, status, duration; filter by kind / status / text; export CSV; clear-all with two-step confirm; **Rerun** any past job with one click.
- **Lifetime Totals drawer** — bytes, files, jobs, errors, by-kind breakdown, 30-day sparkline.
- **Per-file live counter**, verbose compact ETA (`3h 10m 38s`), average MiB/s — header never says "calculating…" when idle.
- **When-done action** — keep app open, close app, log off, shut down, sleep.
- **System tray** with minimize-to-tray-on-close option.
- **Drag-and-drop and picker** entry points: drag onto the window, or use *Add files* / *Add folders* in the header.
- **Shell integration** — Windows IExplorerCommand, macOS Finder Sync, Linux `.desktop` / KDE ServiceMenu / Thunar UCA all route into the same queue via `copythat --enqueue <verb> <paths…> [--destination <dst>]`.
- **Global paste hotkey** — press Ctrl+Shift+V (Windows / Linux) or Cmd+Shift+V (macOS) anywhere on the system to paste files copied from Explorer / Finder / Files through Copy That's staging dialog. Combo is user-configurable; the shortcut can be toggled off entirely.
- **Clipboard watcher** (opt-in) — surfaces a toast when file URLs land on the OS clipboard, hinting the paste hotkey is ready. Polls every 500 ms while enabled; silent when off.
- **Secure delete** — single-pass zero / random, DoD 3-pass, DoD 7-pass, Gutmann 35-pass, NIST 800-88. SSD-aware (skips multi-pass overwrites on SSDs by default — use TRIM instead).
- **Read-through-snapshot for locked files** — when another process holds the source open for exclusive write, Copy That can pull a read-only filesystem snapshot (VSS on Windows, ZFS / Btrfs on Linux, APFS local snapshot on macOS) and copy from there instead of surfacing the "file in use" error. Opt-in via Settings → Transfer → "When a file is locked". The Windows path spawns a sibling `copythat-helper-vss.exe` via UAC so the main app never needs elevation of its own.
- **Crash / reboot resume** — every 50 ms the copy engine fsync's the destination and writes a checkpoint to a redb-backed journal at `<data-dir>/copythat-journal.redb` (carrying the running BLAKE3 of consumed source bytes). On the next launch Copy That detects unfinished jobs, BLAKE3-verifies the partial destination's prefix, and seeks both source and destination past the verified offset — power-cut at 96 % of a 2 TB transfer no longer means starting over. Toggle "Auto-resume interrupted jobs without prompting" in Settings → General to skip the resume modal.
- **Bandwidth shaping** — Settings → Network lets you cap transfers at a fixed MB/s, follow a daily rclone-style schedule (`08:00,512k 18:00,10M Sat-Sun,unlimited`), or react automatically to metered Wi-Fi / battery / cellular. Cap applies globally across every in-flight job; a minute-tick poller re-evaluates the schedule so a 09:00 boundary change hot-swaps the live rate without touching running jobs. Header badge (🔻 30 MB/s · scheduled) shows the active cap — click it to open the Network tab. GCRA token bucket via the `governor` crate is accurate to a handful of milliseconds across the full range (1 KB/s → storage-native ceiling).
- **Sparse file preservation** — a 100 GB VM disk with 1 MB of real data stays 1 MB on disk at the destination. Copy That detects allocated extents via `SEEK_HOLE` / `SEEK_DATA` on Linux / macOS and `FSCTL_QUERY_ALLOCATED_RANGES` on Windows, marks the destination sparse (NTFS `FSCTL_SET_SPARSE`; automatic on APFS / ext4 / Btrfs / XFS / ZFS / ReFS), and seeks-copies only the allocated ranges so holes are preserved by omission. Toggle in Settings → Transfer → *Preserve sparse files* (default on); destinations that can't preserve sparseness (exFAT / FAT32 / HFS+) raise a one-shot "destination fills sparse files" toast and densify.
- **Security metadata preservation** — out-of-band metadata streams round-trip across every copy: Windows NTFS Alternate Data Streams (including the **Mark-of-the-Web** `Zone.Identifier` that SmartScreen and Office Protected View key off — a downloaded `.exe` keeps its origin warning after the copy), Linux extended attributes + POSIX ACLs + SELinux contexts + file capabilities (`security.capability`), macOS xattrs (Gatekeeper `com.apple.quarantine`, Spotlight `kMDItemWhereFroms`, Finder color tags) + the legacy resource fork at `<file>/..namedfork/rsrc`. Cross-FS destinations that can't hold the foreign metadata (SMB / FAT / exFAT / ext4 receiving Mac data) automatically fall through to an `._<filename>` AppleDouble v2 sidecar so the data survives the trip. Settings → Transfer → "Security metadata" gives per-stream toggles; the MOTW toggle carries an explicit security warning since disabling it lets a downloaded executable shed its origin marker on copy.
- **Two-way sync with conflict detection** — configure a sync pair (two folders on any filesystem) and Copy That reconciles them without silent overwrites. Per-file vector clocks persisted in `<left>/.copythat-sync.db` (redb) detect three cases: one side is an ancestor of the other (propagate), both diverged concurrently from a common ancestor (conflict), or vectors match but content diverged (corrupt). Concurrent edits are never auto-resolved destructively — the losing side's content is preserved in place as `name.sync-conflict-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<host>.ext`, and both versions surface in the Sync drawer for per-file resolution (Keep left / Keep right / Keep both). Four modes: two-way, mirror (either direction), and contribute (one-way upload that never deletes on the receiver). Moves model as delete+add until the three-tree state machine lands in Phase 52.
- **Real-time mirror (live sync)** — toggle "Start live mirror" on any sync pair and Copy That watches the left-side folder (ReadDirectoryChangesW on Windows, FSEvents on macOS, inotify on Linux) and re-syncs on every debounced change. Edge cases that normally produce spurious sync rounds — vim's `:wq` dance (5 inotify events, 1 logical save), Word's `~$lock` + temp-rename dance, atomic writes like `write-to-tmp → fsync → rename-over` — all collapse to a single `Modified(file.ext)` event by the watcher's filter + atomic-save tracker + priority-ordered debounce queue (Removed > Renamed > Modified > Created). Windows ReadDirectoryChangesW buffer overflows trigger a recovery rescan so no change is silently dropped; macOS FSEvents directory-coalesce signals are resolved by synchronous enumeration. One background thread per active pair, surfaced in the UI as a green pulsing dot + "Watching" badge.

### Internationalisation

- **18 languages** shipped in full: Arabic, Chinese (Simplified), Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Spanish, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese.
- **Fluent**-based (`.ftl`) key system with `xtask i18n-lint` enforcing key parity + syntax.
- **RTL support** (Arabic) with `dir="rtl"` on the root and icon mirroring.
- **Locale-driven formatting**: `Intl.NumberFormat` for bytes / percent / counts, `Intl.DisplayNames` for language pickers (each language renders in its own endonym + in the active UI locale).
- **Reactive translation switching** — changes apply instantly across every modal, drawer, and badge without reload.

### Cloud backends (Phase 32)

- **12 backends via OpenDAL + one custom SFTP path**: Amazon S3, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage, OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, WebDAV, FTP, LocalFs — plus SFTP via a pure-Rust MIT-licensed `russh` / `russh-sftp` backend (avoids OpenDAL's GPL-blocked `services-sftp`).
- **Settings → Remotes tab** for add / remove / test-connection; secrets live in the OS keychain (Apple Keychain / Windows Credential Manager / Secret Service / kwallet) under `copythat-cloud/<backend-name>`, never in `settings.toml`.
- **Engine-level cloud destinations**: `copy_file` routes through `CopyOptions::cloud_sink` when the destination is remote, streaming the source in `buffer_size` chunks through `opendal::Operator::writer()` with multipart upload handled transparently (S3-class backends). Progress events fire per-chunk with running byte counts.
- **Verify-on-remote** with four algorithms (BLAKE3, SHA-256, MD5, round-trip). The server-side checksum fast-path (ETag on S3-class, `content-md5` on Azure Blob) skips the round-trip fetch when the backend exposes a comparable hash.
- **OAuth device-code flow** for Microsoft Graph + Google Drive + Dropbox, plus an **RFC 7636 PKCE browser-redirect flow** for providers where device-code isn't available. Refresh-token flow preserves the old refresh_token when providers (MS Graph) omit it on refresh. Loopback HTTP receiver on `127.0.0.1:<auto-port>` catches the authorize redirect.
- **SFTP key forms**: password (default), unencrypted OpenSSH private key (`KEY\n<body>`), encrypted OpenSSH private key (`KEY_ENC\n<passphrase>\n<body>`). `known_hosts` pinning with both plain + hashed `|1|salt|hmac` entries (HMAC-SHA1 host matching). Connection pooling via an `Arc<AsyncMutex<PooledSession>>` so concurrent put / get calls reuse a live SSH channel and re-handshake lazily on error.
- **Resume journal awareness**: `JobRecord::remote_backend_name` distinguishes cloud-dst from local-dst at startup-resume time; cross-process MPU resume is intentionally not handled (Copy That's remote-destination model is idempotent re-copy).

### Mount the archive (Phase 33)

- **Cross-platform read-only mount** of the Copy That snapshot history: `by-date/YYYY-MM-DD/HH-MM-SS/<job>` + `by-source/<escaped-src-root>/<timestamp>` + `by-job-id/<row-id>/<job>`. The mount exposes historical copies as plain folders — `cat` / Explorer / Finder all work.
- **FUSE** on Linux/macOS behind `--features fuse` (pulls `fuser` 0.15, MIT). Real `fuser::Filesystem` trait impl with `lookup` / `getattr` / `readdir` / `read` consulting `TreeInodeMap` + the Phase 27 chunk store.
- **WinFsp** on Windows behind `--features winfsp` (pulls `winfsp_wrs` 0.4, MIT — replaces the GPL-blocked `winfsp-sys`). Real `winfsp_wrs::FileSystemInterface` impl overriding `get_volume_info`, `get_security_by_name`, `open`, `close`, `read`, `read_directory`, `get_file_info`. Default SDDL (`D:P(A;;GR;;;WD)`) grants everyone generic-read.
- **Chunk-streaming reads**: `read` callbacks walk each item's Phase 27 manifest by cursor, fetching only chunks that overlap `[offset, offset+size)` — multi-GB snapshots don't spike memory.
- **History context menu**: *Mount snapshot* on any successful history row opens a directory picker + dispatches the mount IPC; *Settings → Advanced* has a *Mount latest on launch* toggle.
- **USER ACTION** to validate real kernel mounts: run `cargo test -p copythat-mount --features fuse` on Linux/macOS, or `cargo test -p copythat-mount --features winfsp` on Windows (requires the WinFsp driver + LLVM libclang installed — see [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) Phase 33g for the exact `winget` commands).

### Enterprise audit log (Phase 34)

- **Eight typed events** — `JobStarted`, `JobCompleted`, `FileCopied`, `FileFailed`, `CollisionResolved`, `SettingsChanged`, `LoginEvent`, `UnauthorizedAccess` — are written into an append-only log sink every time the engine hits a user-visible transition.
- **Five wire formats** ship simultaneously: **CSV** (eight-column stable header for spreadsheet forensics), **JSON-lines** (default, pipe-friendly), **Syslog RFC 5424** (structured-data block `[copythat@32473 jobId="..." user="..."]`), **ArcSight CEF v0** (`CEF:0|CopyThat|CopyThat|<ver>|<sig>|<name>|<sev>|<ext>`), and **IBM QRadar LEEF 2.0** (tab-separated extension, `LEEF:2.0|CopyThat|CopyThat|<ver>|<eventID>|<ext>`).
- **Tamper-evident chain**: every record embeds `prev_hash = BLAKE3(previous_record_bytes)` as a hex column; one edit anywhere in the file cascades into every subsequent record's chain step. The Settings → *Verify chain* button + the Phase 36 CLI's `copythat audit verify <log>` catch single-byte tampering.
- **WORM (write-once-read-many)** is an opt-in Settings toggle that applies the platform's append-only primitive after every create / rotate: Linux `FS_IOC_SETFLAGS | FS_APPEND_FL` (requires CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE), macOS `chflags(UF_APPEND)`, Windows `FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READONLY` (the richer deny-write ACE path is a Phase 36 follow-up).
- **Rotation** rolls the log to `<path>.1` at a byte threshold (default 10 MiB, slider in Settings); the rollover re-applies the WORM attribute to the fresh file.
- **Tracing fan-out**: `tracing_subscriber::Layer` captures any `target = "copythat::audit"` log from the rest of the workspace into the sink so ad-hoc `warn!` calls auditors care about land in the same file.
- **Settings → Advanced → Audit log** surfaces the enable toggle, format picker, file path, rotation threshold, WORM toggle, and *Test write* + *Verify chain* buttons. The sink hot-swaps on every `update_settings` without restart.

### Encryption + on-the-fly compression (Phase 35)

- **Destination encryption via [age](https://age-encryption.org/)** — passphrase, X25519 (`age1…`), or SSH ed25519 / RSA recipients. Output is bit-for-bit compatible with the upstream `rage` CLI's binary format, so a future user can decrypt with the official `rage` binary without Copy That in the loop.
- **On-the-fly zstd compression** with three modes: *Off* (default), *Always* (every file at the chosen level), *Smart* (every file *except* a built-in 38-extension deny list covering jpg / mp4 / zip / 7z / pdf / msi / iso / etc. — re-compressing already-compressed media wastes CPU and can grow the file). User can append extra extensions to the Smart deny list.
- **zstd level 1–22 slider** in Settings → Transfer → Compression. Default is 3 (zstd's CLI default and the workspace's "fast + useful" pick); higher numbers compress harder at progressively-larger CPU cost.
- **Live compression metrics**: every file's `CopyEvent::CompressionSavings { ratio, bytes_saved }` event powers a footer "💾 256 MiB → 84 MiB (67% saved)" badge against the running tree totals.
- **Engine pipeline** (when either stage is active): `src bytes → optional zstd encoder → optional age encryptor → dst`. The pipeline runs on a `spawn_blocking` worker so age + zstd (both sync-first libraries) compose cleanly with the async copy engine. Fast paths + verify + sparse + chunk-store + journal are auto-bypassed because byte-level invariants don't hold against a transformed destination.
- **Decryption is symmetric**: `copythat_crypt::decrypted_reader` accepts a passphrase, X25519 secret key, or SSH private key — same `Identity` bag, same age-format input. The runner's auto-decrypt-on-copy-FROM-`.age` flow lands in a Phase 35 follow-up.
- **Settings → Transfer → Encryption + Compression** carries the mode pickers, recipients-file path, and the level slider. The passphrase modal flow (collect at copy-start, hold in `secrecy::SecretString` for the duration of the run) is deferred to a Phase 35 follow-up — today the runner falls back to plain copy when the user selects `passphrase` mode and logs the reason.

### Mobile companion (Phase 37)

- **PWA over PeerJS WebRTC.** The phone-side app at [`apps/copythat-mobile/`](apps/copythat-mobile/) is a Vite + Svelte 5 Progressive Web App. Users open the deployed URL in their phone browser, scan the desktop's pairing QR with the system camera, and tap "Add to Home Screen" — the manifest reuses the desktop's icon so the home-screen launcher matches the desktop tray. **No App Store gate.**
- **Pairing protocol.** Settings → Mobile shows a `cthat-pair://<peer-id>?sas=<base32-256-bit>` QR. The PWA scans it, opens a PeerJS data channel against the desktop's stable peer-id, and both sides derive the same four-emoji SAS short-authentication-string from `SHA-256(seed ‖ desktop_pubkey ‖ phone_pubkey)`. The user confirms the four glyphs match; pairing commits.
- **Always-on availability.** "Always connect to Mobile App" toggle (Settings → Mobile) registers the desktop's persisted peer-id with the PeerJS broker on every launch, so paired phones can connect anytime the desktop is running. Auto-connect requires at least one paired device — the runner shows the install QR + "pair a phone first" prompt instead of registering when no pairing exists.
- **Full remote control surface.** The PWA drives every active job (pause / resume / cancel), resolves collisions (overwrite / overwrite-all / skip / skip-all / rename / keep-both), kicks off saved profiles + history reruns, fires secure-delete jobs, and shows live globals (percentage to two decimals, files-done / files-total, rate, per-operation tally) plus a streaming "files being processed" panel that scrolls individual filenames as the desktop walks the tree.
- **Loading-state lock.** When the desktop is enumerating files (after a Re-run / Start Copy / etc.), all PWA control buttons disable until the desktop emits `JobReady` so the user can't fire conflicting commands during the load phase.
- **Keep desktop awake.** PWA toggle that asks the desktop to inhibit screensaver / sleep while the connection is live — `SetThreadExecutionState` on Windows, `IOPMAssertionCreateWithName` on macOS, `org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver.Inhibit` on Linux. The OS-level wake-lock glue lives in `copythat-platform` (Phase 37 follow-up); the IPC + setting are wired today.
- **Synchronized state.** Pause / cancel / resume that originates on the desktop UI flows back to the PWA via `JobStateChanged` streaming events; the inverse path uses standard request / `Ok` reply. Desktop exit emits `ServerShuttingDown` so the PWA shows an explicit "Desktop exited — reconnect when Copy That is running again" screen instead of a generic disconnect.
- **Push notifications.** APNs ES256 JWT + FCM RS256 JWT signers in `copythat_mobile::notify` for completion notifications when the data channel is asleep. Real provider-token signing is wired today; the runner reads the credentials out of the `MobileSettings` blob (the keychain migration lands in a Phase 37 follow-up).
- **Exit button.** Phone-side button cleanly disconnects PeerJS, sends `Goodbye`, and clears the in-memory session so a closed tab can't accidentally leak a control link.
- **Broker supply-chain audit.** The Phase 42 fix-swarm verified `peerjs@^1.5.5` is actively maintained (1.5.5 / Jun 2025 / MIT) and ruled out a replacement; the documented mitigation is to self-host the broker rather than rely on the public `0.peerjs.com` default. Full evaluation + four-candidate comparison in [`docs/PEERJS_REPLACEMENT_PLAN.md`](docs/PEERJS_REPLACEMENT_PLAN.md).

### `copythat` CLI (Phase 36)

- **`copythat <SUBCOMMAND>`** — a real command-line interface suitable for CI/CD pipelines, automation scripts, and headless servers. Top-level commands: `copy`, `move`, `sync`, `shred`, `verify`, `history`, `stack`, `remote`, `mount`, `audit`, `plan`, `apply`, `version`, `config`, and `completions`.
- **Stable JSON-Lines output** via `--json` — one tagged JSON object per line on `stdout` with twelve canonical event kinds (`job_started` / `job_progress` / `job_completed` / `job_failed` / `plan_action` / `plan_summary` / `version` / `config_value` / `verify_ok` / `verify_failed` / `info` / `error`). Every line carries a UTC `ts` field, so `jq -r 'select(.kind=="job_progress")' < log.ndjson` pipes work out of the box.
- **Nine documented exit codes** — `0` success, `1` generic error, `2` pending actions (plan), `3` collisions unresolved, `4` verify failed, `5` network unreachable, `6` permission denied, `7` disk full, `8` user canceled, `9` config invalid. Surfaced as a `#[repr(u8)]` enum so the numeric values cannot drift between releases.
- **Declarative TOML jobspec** drives `plan` (no-mutation; reports the action list and exits 2 with pending) and `apply` (runs the same plan; idempotent — re-runs on a finished tree exit 0 with zero new actions). Spec layout: `[job] kind / source / destination / verify / shape / preserve / collisions`, plus `[retry]` and an optional `[schedule]`.
- **Shell completions** for bash / zsh / fish / pwsh / elvish via `copythat completions <SHELL>`. Redirect `stdout` to the shell's per-user completion location; the CLI itself never writes files.
- **Stub commands for cross-cutting features** (sync / shred / stack / remote / mount / audit) accept the same flag surface the GUI uses so scripts written today don't break when the wiring lands in a follow-up phase. Each stub exits `1` and emits a clearly-labelled `cli-info-stub-deferred` JSON event.

### SMB compression + cloud-VM offload helper (Phase 40)

- **SMB 3.1.1 traffic compression badge** — when the destination is a UNC path on Windows, Copy That requests `COPY_FILE_REQUEST_COMPRESSED_TRAFFIC` on every `CopyFileExW` / `CopyFile2` invocation and surfaces a teal "🗜 SMB compress: \<algo\>" pill in the header bar while the job runs. The flag is a *request* to the kernel — the SMB 3.1.1 server independently decides per-share whether to compress, and Windows does not surface the negotiated chained-compression algorithm (`XPRESS_LZ77` / `XPRESS_HUFFMAN` / `LZNT1`) to user mode, so today's badge labels a successful flag-pass rather than a confirmed compressed wire. Free win on slow remote links; ignored on local destinations.
- **Cloud-VM offload helper wizard** in Settings → Remotes lets the user pair two configured backends (e.g. an S3 source + an Azure Blob destination), pick a deployment-template format (cloud-init / AWS Terraform / Azure ARM / GCP Deployment Manager), tune the knob set (job_name / region / instance_size / iam_role / self_destruct_minutes), and render a deployment template they paste into their cloud's console (or `terraform apply`). Templates run the copy on a tiny ephemeral VM *inside* the cloud network so bytes never touch the user's laptop. **Templates never embed cloud credentials** — the deployed VM relies on IAM-role / managed-identity / service-account access the user provisions out-of-band; the renderer assumes nothing about credential plumbing. Every template ships a `shutdown -h +N` watchdog (clamped at 1 minute minimum) so a botched copy doesn't accrue cost. The Azure ARM `customData` field is base64-encoded inline so the deployment boots cloud-init correctly without a manual encode step. User-supplied label fields (job_name / region / iam_role / etc.) are sanitised against an `[A-Za-z0-9._/@:+-]` allowlist before substitution as defense-in-depth against shell / HCL / YAML / JSON metacharacters.
- **Probe API**: `smb_compression_state(dst_path)` IPC command returns `{ supported, algorithm }` for an arbitrary destination so a future Settings-level "test connection" UX can preview the badge before queueing the copy.

### Pre-flight tree-diff preview (Phase 41)

- **`compute_tree_diff(src, dst, opts)`** — the engine walks the source tree, stat's the destination side per file, and classifies every pair into Addition / Replacement / Skip / Conflict / Unchanged. Mtime compare uses a 1-second cross-FS rounding tolerance so two files differing only by NTFS-vs-ext4 timestamp granularity classify as Same rather than spurious replacements.
- **TreeDiffPreview modal** in the UI shows the rolled-up plan before the engine starts work: counts per category, bytes-to-transfer running total, expandable per-row lists in their respective category colours (green=add, yellow=replace, grey=skip, red=conflict, dim=unchanged). The Run button is gated on `hasBlockingConflicts` so the operator must either reduce the plan or resolve conflicts before the run can start — no silent data loss.
- **Three classifications surface non-obvious cases**: `ForceOverwriteOlder` (orange row — user opted into "always overwrite" so we'll replace even when the destination's mtime is newer), `KindMismatch` (file-vs-directory clash that the engine refuses to resolve silently), and `Ambiguous` (sizes + mtimes both differ within the cross-FS tolerance, requiring operator input). The full virtualized side-by-side trees + 1.5 s post-Run morph animation land in a follow-up — the engine + IPC + locale layer is stable enough that the animation pass can ship independently.

### Visual-similarity dedup + per-file rolling versions (Phase 42)

- **Perceptual-hash visual-similarity warning** — the new `copythat-perceptual` crate (pure Rust, MIT/Apache-2.0: `image_hasher` 3.x + `image` 0.25 with PNG / JPEG / BMP / WebP / GIF decoders) computes a 64-bit perceptual fingerprint of the destination side before the engine overwrites it. When a visually-identical image is about to be clobbered, the UI surfaces a "looks visually identical" prompt with Keep both / Skip / Overwrite anyway. Hash uses the upstream `DoubleGradient` algorithm, folded to a `u64` for cheap chunk-store storage. `similarity(a, b)` returns a normalised Hamming distance in `[0.0, 1.0]`; the `SIMILARITY_DEFAULT_THRESHOLD = 0.10` constant tunes the warn-on-this-or-below sensitivity. **Never use perceptual hashes as a content-integrity check** — that's what the BLAKE3 verifier is for.
- **Per-file rolling versions (Time Machine for any destination)** — the engine snapshots an existing destination file *before* overwriting it whenever the user opts into Settings → Transfer → "Keep previous versions on overwrite." The snapshot is captured into the Phase 27 chunk store (deduped by content), and a row lands in the new `versions` table of the History database with the destination path, capture timestamp, manifest BLAKE3, size, optional retention floor, and the triggering copy job's id. Settings → Versions surfaces a per-path version list with Restore (one click rolls a destination back to any captured snapshot).
- **Four retention policies** decide which snapshots survive:
  - **None** — keep every version forever (default; explicit user opt-in pattern). Storage cost grows monotonically — fine on a few-files setup, dangerous on a rapidly-changing tree.
  - **Last N** — keep the N newest snapshots; drop the rest. `N = 0` is silently treated as `N = 1` so the freshly-captured snapshot is always retained.
  - **Older than X days** — drop snapshots whose capture timestamp falls more than X days before "now". Even at `X = 0` the freshest snapshot survives.
  - **Grandfather-Father-Son (GFS)** — group versions into per-hour / per-day / per-week / per-month UTC buckets, keep the newest version in each of the most recent N buckets per tier, drop the rest. Buckets are unioned (a version that survives in any tier is retained), so a typical "24h hourly · 7 daily · 4 weekly · 12 monthly" config covers a year of history at a fraction of the disk cost of "keep everything."
- **Engine integration is best-effort by contract**: the snapshot hook fires on a `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` worker so it doesn't stall the copy hot path; if the chunk store is unavailable, the snapshot fails, the engine logs a `tracing::warn!`, and the copy proceeds normally. A failing snapshot must NEVER abort a user copy.

### WASM plugin runtime (Phase 46 — in progress; 46.1 + 46.2 shipped)

- **Engine + ABI shipped.** New `copythat-plugin` workspace crate wraps a real `wasmtime::Engine` (cranelift JIT, default config). `PluginHost::load_plugin(<path>)` reads `.wasm` (or `.wat`) bytes from disk and compiles them; `PluginHandle::call_hook(kind, ctx)` dispatches through a JSON-over-linear-memory ABI — the plugin must export `memory`, `alloc(size: i32) -> i32` (returns a pointer to a fresh buffer), and `hook(ctx_ptr: i32, ctx_len: i32) -> i64` (reads the JSON `HookCtx`, returns a packed `(out_ptr << 32) | out_len` pointing at the JSON `HookOutcome` response). Each call uses a fresh `wasmtime::Store` so plugins are stateless across calls; sandbox state lands when 46.4 ships.
- **Lifecycle hooks the engine dispatches.** `BeforeJob`, `BeforeFile`, `AfterFile`, `AfterJob`, `OnError`. Plugin response is one of `Continue`, `SkipFile`, `AbortJob`, or `Notify { message }`; the engine acts on the decoded outcome (skip the current file, abort the job, raise a tray/log notification, or proceed normally). `HookKind` serialises as snake_case and `HookOutcome` uses an internally-tagged `{"kind":"…"}` JSON shape so the ABI plugins compile against today is stable before sandbox budgets and capability gating arrive.
- **Not yet user-accessible.** CPU + memory sandbox budgets and pruned `wasmtime` features (46.3), plugin manifest (`plugin.toml`) parsing + capability gating (`read_fs:<scope>` etc., 46.4), sample plugins `organize-by-exif` / `notify-discord` / `notify-ntfy` / `dedup-warning` (46.5), and the Settings → Plugins UI tab + install-from-file/URL flow (46.6) all land in later sub-phases. No plugins ship in the binary today, and there is no UI surface to enable them yet.

### Drag-progress-merge + named queues + F2 + tray destinations (Phase 45)

- **Per-drive named queues.** `copythat-core::QueueRegistry` partitions queued jobs by physical destination drive (`copythat_platform::volume_id` on Windows VolumeSerialNumber, `st_dev` on Unix) so two transfers to the same disk share one queue and never compete for spindle / NAND head time, while transfers to *different* drives spawn parallel queues that actually run in parallel. The legacy `state.queue` stays in place as the back-compat default queue (`QueueId::DEFAULT`) so every existing entry point keeps working without changes.
- **Tab strip with drag-merge.** New `JobListTabs.svelte` renders one ARIA tab per registry queue (label = drive letter or `"queue N"`; badge = Pending+Running count) plus a synthesised `Default` tab covering legacy-queue work. Drag any registry tab onto another to fire `queue_merge(srcId, dstId)` — the Rust side moves the jobs, removes the source queue, and the broadcast `queue-merged` / `queue-removed` events refresh the tab strip without polling. Auto-hides when the registry is empty so cold-launch UX is unchanged.
- **F2 queue mode (auto-enqueue-next).** Pressing F2 in the main window flips `QueueRegistry::auto_enqueue_next` so every fresh enqueue piles into the running queue rather than spawning a parallel one — the workflow Total Commander / Directory Opus power users expect when they want copies to serialise. Window-scoped (not the system-wide `tauri-plugin-global-shortcut` plugin); the keydown handler skips presses while the user is typing in INPUT / TEXTAREA / SELECT / contenteditable so a real rename gesture isn't intercepted, and ignores any modifier-laden F2 combos. Visual feedback: a CSS-keyframed pulsing dot on the running tab (respects `prefers-reduced-motion`) plus a green `F2 queue mode: ON` pill in the Footer. F2 mode is intentionally not persisted across launches — transient per-session state.
- **Tray-pinned destinations + active-target drop fast path.** Settings → General → "Tray destinations" lets the operator pin local paths or any Phase 32 backend URI (label + path); pinned rows materialise as items in the OS tray menu between Drop Stack and Quit. Clicking a tray item arms it as the active drop target, surfaces a blue `→ {label}` pill in the Footer, and the next file drop into the main window bypasses DropStagingDialog entirely — the engine starts copying straight to the pinned destination. One-shot semantics (the activation clears after the first drop); clicking the Footer pill clears it without dropping anything. Pin/unpin commands rebuild the tray menu in place via Tauri's `tray_by_id` + `set_menu` so the operator doesn't have to relaunch.
- **Window-to-window drag-merge — deferred.** Tauri 2's `WindowEvent::DragDrop` doesn't expose HTML5 cross-window drag transfer; the title-bar drag-source / cross-process IPC pattern would need a custom protocol with native-level event interception. The single-instance-plugin design also means there's only ever one CopyThat window per session today. Parked until a Tauri capability lands or a multi-window multi-instance use case materialises.

### SSD-honest secure delete (Phase 44 + 44.1 + 44.2 + 44.3 + 44.4)

Phase 44.4 ships three small advisory-only additions that move
the Windows + macOS sanitize surface from "stub" to "advisory"
without enabling any new destructive paths. **44.4a Windows
SANICAP reporting** — the IOCTL probe now also issues an
`IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY` /
`StorageAdapterProtocolSpecificProperty` round-trip carrying
NVMe Identify Controller (CNS=1) and parses the SANICAP field
at byte offset 331-334 of the 4096-byte response (NVM Express
§5.15.2.2); `WindowsSanitizeHelper::capabilities` surfaces the
decoded modes (`nvme-sanitize-crypto` / `nvme-sanitize-block` /
`nvme-format`) so the operator sees what the controller
advertises before the destructive path lands. **44.4b macOS
APFS scaffold** — adds `SsdSanitizeMode::ApfsCryptoErase` +
`MacosSanitizeHelper::run_apfs_crypto_erase` that validates the
device path and probes for an APFS container via `diskutil
info`; the destructive `diskutil apfs deleteContainer`
invocation is gated behind hardware-validation. **44.4c TCG OPAL
packet-encoding scaffold** — new
`crates/copythat-secure-delete/src/opal.rs` module behind the
`experimental-tcg-opal` feature flag carries the
`ComPacket` / `Packet` / `SubPacket` marshalers + RevertSP
token-stream encoder; pure data transformation, no transport.
The actual destructive paths (Windows
`IOCTL_STORAGE_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_OUT` shipping the OPAL
packets, macOS container delete, Linux SG_IO replacing sedutil)
defer to Phase 44.5 once a hardware test bed is wired.

Phase 44.3 closes the Phase 44.2 SECURITY MEDIUM finding by
installing a `prctl(PR_SET_DUMPABLE, 0)` hook on the sedutil-cli
child process — `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` is no longer readable by
other UIDs while the OPAL PSID-revert is running, so an
unprivileged local attacker racing `cat /proc/*/cmdline` cannot
capture the PSID. The Windows path now ships a real
`IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY` capability probe (vendor /
product / serial / TRIM-supported) + physical-drive enumeration
via the safe-FFI seam in `copythat-platform`; Tauri's device
picker populates on Windows instead of asking the user to type
`\\.\PhysicalDriveN` paths manually.

Phase 44.2 wired the Tauri IPC bridge on top of Phase 44.1's
platform helpers: `sanitize_capabilities_cmd` / `sanitize_run` /
`sanitize_free_space_trim` / `sanitize_list_devices` Tauri
commands; `SanitizeTab.svelte` now binds live to those commands
and listens for `sanitize-progress` / `-completed` / `-failed`
events with a stale-event guard. The Tauri runner installs the
platform `is_cow_filesystem` probe at app startup so the per-file
shredder refuses honestly on Btrfs / ZFS / APFS / bcachefs / ReFS
/ thin-LVM (44.2c added thin-LVM detection on Linux via
`/proc/self/mountinfo` + `/sys/dev/block/M:m/dm/uuid`). New
TCG OPAL PSID-revert path on Linux via `sedutil-cli` (44.2d). The
defense-in-depth third-confirmation gate is enforced server-side
in `sanitize_run` (model-name re-validation against live
capability probe, ASCII-only to defeat Unicode-confusable
bypass). Phase 44.2 review-pass closed 1 security MEDIUM (PSID
argv leak on multi-user Linux — documented; Phase 44.3 piping-
via-stdin mitigation), 2 Critical (listener leak; Unicode
match), 2 High (mountinfo prefix + shadowing), 2 Medium (PSID
length; macOS partition pollution).

Phase 44.1 layered the platform helpers on top of the Phase 44
trait surface — the `copythat-secure-delete` crate now ships
`LinuxSanitizeHelper` (nvme-cli + hdparm shell-outs with validated
device paths + `--` end-of-options separator, hex/decimal SANICAP
parse, 2s SPROG-poll timeout), `MacosSanitizeHelper` (diskutil for
free-space TRIM), and a `WindowsSanitizeHelper` stub pending the
Phase 44.3 DeviceIoControl wiring. New `free_space_trim` async
API + `ShredEvent::SanitizeProgress` event + Settings → Drive
sanitize tab with three-confirmation UX. Phase 44.1 review-pass
closed a security MEDIUM (argument-injection via leading-dash
device paths) plus three correctness items (hex SANICAP, SPROG
timeout, blocking_send → try_send) before commit.



- **Whole-drive sanitize via firmware** — NVMe Sanitize Crypto Erase (instant; rotates the drive's media key), NVMe Sanitize Block Erase (every cell), NVMe Format with Secure Erase (FSE bit), ATA Secure Erase (legacy SATA SSDs), and TCG OPAL Crypto Erase (Self-Encrypting Drives). The new `SsdSanitizeMode` enum + `whole_drive_sanitize` async API + `sanitize_capabilities` probe live in `copythat-secure-delete::sanitize`. The actual privileged command runs through a pluggable `SanitizeHelper` trait — `NoopSanitizeHelper` ships as a safe-by-default fallback that refuses every call; the real Linux (`nvme-cli` / `hdparm` via `copythat-helper`) and Windows (`DeviceIoControl(IOCTL_STORAGE_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_OUT)`) impls land in a Phase 44.1 follow-up.
- **Per-file shred refusal on copy-on-write filesystems.** New `ShredErrorKind::ShredMeaningless` variant. When the user calls `shred_file` on a path that resides on Btrfs / ZFS / APFS (CoW filesystems where block-level overwrite cannot reach the original content because the FS reuses storage on next write), the shredder refuses with a localized explanation pointing at whole-drive sanitize plus full-disk-encryption key rotation. The CoW-detection probe itself is a Phase 44.1 follow-up — first cut ships the contract + the refusal helper, with a stub detector that returns `false` everywhere; the smoke test exercises the refusal via direct invocation of `refuse_shred_on_cow`.
- **Three-confirmation contract documented in the Rust API.** The `whole_drive_sanitize` docstring carries a `# Caller contract` heading making it explicit: (1) UI must hammer the user with three confirmations before invoking; (2) cancel-after-dispatch is unsupported because `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` does not cancel the OS thread when the JoinHandle drops — a misbehaving helper outlives the engine task; (3) caller is responsible for verifying the helper binary's authenticity.
- **No new third-party crates.** Everything routes through the existing `tokio` runtime + the future privileged helper IPC; deny.toml is unchanged.
- **16 new Fluent keys** (`sanitize-*`, `ssd-honest-*`) cover the Settings → Drive sanitize subsection, the three-confirmation prose, the run-state messages, and the localized `ShredMeaningless` / SSD advisory text. EN authoritative; 17 non-EN locales ship MT drafts.

### Forensic chain-of-custody (Phase 43)

- **Signed BLAKE3 + ed25519 manifest** per copy job, written as canonical CBOR (RFC 8949) at `<dst-root>/.copythat-provenance.cbor`. The new `copythat-provenance` crate (pure Rust, permissive licenses: `bao` 0.13 MIT/Apache-2.0, `ed25519-dalek` 2 BSD-3-Clause, `ciborium` 0.2 Apache-2.0) computes a per-file BLAKE3 root + Bao verified-streaming outboard during the source-read pass, aggregates them into a manifest with a Merkle root over the per-file roots, and detached-signs that manifest with a user-managed ed25519 key. **Reviewers re-hash the destination tree months later and prove no byte changed since the copy** — `copythat provenance verify <MANIFEST>` re-hashes every file against its claimed root, validates the Merkle root, validates the signature, and reports `tampered: M (paths…)` on any divergence.
- **Engine integration is one extra `update(buf)` call per buffered chunk** — the encoder rides alongside the existing verify hasher's source-read pass. No extra disk reads, no extra threads. Mutually non-exclusive with `--verify <algo>`: provenance gives you a long-term integrity claim, verify gives you a same-job round-trip check.
- **CLI surface**: `copythat provenance verify <MANIFEST> [--trusted-key <PEM>]` (exit 0 clean / 4 tampered / 9 parse error) and `copythat provenance keygen --out <PATH> [--write-public]` (PKCS#8 PEM private key + optional SPKI public-key sidecar).
- **Settings → Provenance UI tab** carries the four spec controls: signing-key generate/import/export, "sign every new job by default" toggle, default RFC 3161 TSA URL field, "show manifest after each completed job" toggle.
- **What the manifest authenticates**: every byte at the recorded `rel_path` matches the BLAKE3 root taken at copy time. Tampering with one byte in one destination file flips its outcome to `Tampered { expected, actual }`; every other file remains `Ok` and the manifest signature stays valid (you don't lose the whole audit on one bit-flip). What it does NOT authenticate: source-side authenticity (the manifest proves the *destination* matches what was hashed, not that the source was genuine) — see [`docs/SECURITY.md`](docs/SECURITY.md) for the full threat model.
- **RFC 3161 timestamping is deferred** — the Phase 43 spec referenced an `rfc3161-client` crate that does not exist on crates.io; the manifest schema reserves `Rfc3161Token { tsa_url, token_der, stamped_at }` but the actual TSA HTTP request is classified `TsaFeatureDisabled` until a follow-up phase wires the client. Default TSA target when it lands: `https://freetsa.org/tsr` (free, opt-in, never on by default).

### Performance

- **Beats every measured competitor on Windows 11 NVMe** (10 GiB · same-volume copy):

  | Tool | MiB/s | vs CopyThat CLI |
  | --- | ---: | ---: |
  | **CopyThat CLI / engine** | **2429** | — |
  | **CopyThat UI (Phase 40)** | **2198** | −9 % |
  | Robocopy | 1305 | **−46 %** |
  | FastCopy | 1006 | **−59 %** |
  | cmd copy | 940-1147 | **−53-61 %** |
  | TeraCopy | 855 | **−65 %** |

  CopyThat's UI also beats every competitor by 68-157 % on the same workload. Caveat: cross-volume copies (C→D, C→E) are bound by the destination disk's write speed and tend to tie across all tools — engine speed only matters when the disk isn't the bottleneck.

- **`PlatformFastCopyHook` everywhere** — every entry point (CLI, UI start_copy, UI rerun, CLI shell-extension enqueue) attaches the hook so reflink + `CopyFileExW` + the Phase 38 dedup ladder are the default fast paths.
- **Phase 40 named-pipe broker** — `copythat-ui --enqueue` invocations forward argv to the running first instance via named pipe in **110 ms** instead of booting a fresh ~5 second Tauri runtime per call.
- **Phase 41 + 42 + 46 topology-driven overlapped-IOCP engagement** — large copies route through the overlapped pipeline whenever the destination's bus class benefits from a deep queue: NVMe at ≥256 MiB on **any** volume pairing (Phase 46 dropped the same-volume gate — modern NVMe sustained bandwidth often beats DRAM-to-DRAM coalescing, so the page cache stops being a useful staging buffer past a few hundred MB); SMB / iSCSI / RAID / VHDX at ≥1 GiB regardless of volume; SATA SSD / USB / SD / HDD only on cross-volume copies ≥1 GiB (the Phase 41 USB-enclosure rule). Each topology gets its own buffer / queue-depth / `NO_BUFFERING` profile via `IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY`. Override via `COPYTHAT_DISABLE_AUTO_OVERLAPPED=1` if the same-volume engagement regresses on specific hardware.
- **Phase 42 attribute probe + sparse-aware CopyFile2** — every copy starts with a `GetFileAttributesExW` snapshot. Sparse sources on Win11 22H2+ route through a new `CopyFile2` path that engages `COPY_FILE_ENABLE_SPARSE_COPY` so unallocated zero ranges are preserved natively. OneDrive cloud-only files (`RECALL_ON_DATA_ACCESS`), reparse points, and EFS-encrypted files are surfaced for downstream policy.
- **Phase 43 / 46 topology-aware `NO_BUFFERING` threshold** — Phase 42's 1 GiB adaptive cap made CopyThat correctly waiting-for-durability look ~30 % slower than `cmd copy` on the bench (cmd's buffered writes return before bytes hit platter). Phase 43 changed the formula to `max(free_phys_ram, 16 GiB)` so the 1–16 GiB band stays cache-friendly and matches competitor wall-clock numbers. Phase 46 makes it bus-aware: NVMe destinations get a 1 GiB floor instead (modern NVMe writes outpace DRAM coalescing past ~1 GiB anyway), other bus types keep the Phase 43 16 GiB / free-RAM rule. Mostly academic when auto-overlapped engages on NVMe at 256 MiB — the plain CopyFileExW path only sees this threshold when `COPYTHAT_DISABLE_AUTO_OVERLAPPED=1` is set. Durability override per-job via `fsync_on_close = true` / `--verify <algo>` / `paranoid_verify`. Env override (`COPYTHAT_NO_BUFFERING_THRESHOLD_MB`) still wins over both.
- **Phase 43 `--quiet` perf mode** — passing `--quiet` to the CLI flips `CopyOptions::disable_progress_callback`; the platform layer then passes `NULL` for `CopyFileExW`'s `lpProgressRoutine` (and equivalent on `CopyFile2`), eliminating the per-kernel-chunk thread-boundary crossing. Measurable on multi-GiB copies. Caveat: in-flight cancel mid-copy is suppressed (Ctrl-C still kills the process).
- **Phase 43 NTFS reflink-probe skip** — destination FS probed once via `GetVolumeInformationW` (replacing a 100-300 ms `Get-Volume` PowerShell shell-out per copy with a 1-2 µs Win32 call); pure-NTFS dests skip the `try_reflink` round-trip entirely (no reflink syscall to attempt on NTFS).
- **Phase 43 single-threaded tokio CLI runtime** — switched from `multi_thread(2)` to `current_thread`. Heavy work runs on `spawn_blocking` either way; the second worker was pure startup cost (~5-10 ms) on the small-file copies where startup dominates wall time.
- **Phase 46 same-volume NVMe overlapped engagement** — pre-Phase 46 only auto-engaged the IOCP overlapped pipeline on cross-volume copies ≥1 GiB, leaving same-volume NVMe stuck at the buffered `CopyFileExW` ceiling (DRAM bandwidth). The new `VolumeTopology::auto_overlapped_threshold(is_cross_volume)` helper drops the same-volume gate on bus classes that always benefit from a deep queue (NVMe → 256 MiB; SMB / iSCSI / RAID / VHDX → 1 GiB; others keep cross-volume + 1 GiB). Same-volume large NVMe copies now stream through `FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED | FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING` with the topology-recommended QD + buffer profile (NVMe → QD 8 / 1 MiB slots).
- **Phase 46 elevated-by-default lazy-zero skip** — `SetFileValidData` skips NTFS's lazy-zero pass over pre-allocated extents (parallel-chunk + overlapped paths), saving the equivalent of one full write-pass of zeros before the actual copy data. Pre-Phase 46 required `COPYTHAT_SKIP_ZERO_FILL=1` even for admin users; Phase 46 probes `SE_MANAGE_VOLUME_NAME` once at startup (cached `OnceLock<bool>`) and defaults the skip ON when held. **"Elevated" means the UAC-elevated token, not just an admin user account** — i.e. the optimization fires when you launch via right-click → "Run as administrator", from an already-elevated cmd / PowerShell, or as the SYSTEM service account. Plain double-click as an admin user (no UAC prompt) leaves the privilege filtered out and the skip stays off (no behavior change). Env var is an explicit override either way: `0` opts out, `1` opts in (no-op when not elevated — `SetFileValidData` returns `ERROR_PRIVILEGE_NOT_HELD` and we silently fall through), unset = default-on iff elevated. Security note: the user's process owns the pre-allocated extent end-to-end and overwrites every byte before any other process can read it.
- **Phase 46 NVMe NO_BUFFERING floor lowered to 1 GiB** — when auto-overlapped is disabled (`COPYTHAT_DISABLE_AUTO_OVERLAPPED=1`), the plain `CopyFileExW` path on NVMe destinations engages `COPY_FILE_NO_BUFFERING` at 1 GiB instead of the 16 GiB floor used for SATA / USB / HDD. Modern NVMe Gen3+ sustained writes outpace DRAM-to-DRAM coalescing past ~1 GiB, so streaming straight to the device is faster AND more durable than the page-cache staging.
- **Phase 42 SMB compressed-traffic flag** — `COPY_FILE_REQUEST_COMPRESSED_TRAFFIC` auto-OR'd onto UNC-path destinations. Free win on slow remote links via SMB v3.1.1 traffic compression negotiation.
- **Phase 42 paranoid verify mode** — `CopyOptions::paranoid_verify` (off by default) drops the destination's page-cache pages before re-reading for hash compare. The only verify mode that catches write-cache lying / silent disk corruption / FS-driver write-path bugs.
- **Phase 42 configurable retry knobs** — `sharing_violation_retries` and `sharing_violation_base_delay_ms` (defaults `3` / `50` ms) match Robocopy `/R:n /W:s` parity. Was a hard-coded 3 × 50 ms.
- **Phase 42 hardlink scaffolding** — `HardlinkSet` data structure + native `CreateHardLinkW` / `std::fs::hard_link` plumbing. Library consumers can preserve hardlink sets today; engine tree-walk integration is Phase 43.
- **Phase 42 OpenZFS 2.2.x corruption warning** — one-shot stderr warning (suppressible via `COPYTHAT_SUPPRESS_ZFS_WARNING=1`) if the host runs OpenZFS 2.2.0-2.2.6 with `zfs_bclone_enabled=1` (openzfs/zfs#15526 data-corruption bug). Reflink path stays active.
- **Phase 42 fix-swarm** — 15 parallel agents addressed every CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM finding from a 10-agent review-swarm pass: HMAC-authenticated named-pipe broker, mobile pairing nonce challenge-response, IOCP loop generation-counter + cancel-drain hardening, CopyFile2 HRESULT facility-7 check, EncryptionSink explicit-finish enforcement, cloud PUT atomicity, audit chain-hash de-circularization, and ~75 more.
- **1 MiB** is the measured optimum buffer size on the default `CopyFileExW` path; all other sizes regressed in the Phase 13b sweep — see [`docs/BENCHMARKS.md`](docs/BENCHMARKS.md).
- **Head-to-head methodology + per-scenario numbers** live in [`COMPETITOR-TEST.md`](COMPETITOR-TEST.md) at the repo root (256 MiB + 10 GiB workloads across same-volume, cross-NTFS, external-SSD destinations).
- **Cross-volume reflink guard** avoids a pointless syscall on copies that can't possibly reflink (different volume IDs). Phase 42 added the `Win11 24H2 + ReFS` skip — on those targets `CopyFileExW` itself fires the block-clone IOCTL natively.
- **Criterion benches** live at `crates/copythat-core/benches/copy_bench.rs`: `single_huge_file`, `buffer_size_sweep`, `many_small_files` (10 KiB / 100 KiB / 1 MiB / 10 MiB mix), `mixed_tree` (10 KiB → 250 MiB).
- **Power-user env-var tunables** documented in [`docs/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md`](docs/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md): `COPYTHAT_PARALLEL_CHUNKS`, `COPYTHAT_OVERLAPPED_IO`, `COPYTHAT_OVERLAPPED_BUFFER_KB`, `COPYTHAT_OVERLAPPED_SLOTS`, `COPYTHAT_OVERLAPPED_NO_BUFFERING`, `COPYTHAT_NO_BUFFERING_THRESHOLD_MB`, `COPYTHAT_SKIP_ZERO_FILL` (Phase 46: defaults on when elevated; set to `0` to opt out), `COPYTHAT_DISABLE_AUTO_OVERLAPPED`.
- **Research underpinnings** — every default backed by data: [`docs/RESEARCH_PHASE_39.md`](docs/RESEARCH_PHASE_39.md) (Win32 + NTFS internals + IoRing + DirectStorage + scatter/gather), [`docs/RESEARCH_PHASE_40.md`](docs/RESEARCH_PHASE_40.md) (UI-bypass + Win32-skip evaluation), [`docs/RESEARCH_PHASE_42.md`](docs/RESEARCH_PHASE_42.md) (270-source swarm deep dive + 21-item gap audit; the basis for the Phase 42 work above).

Lint Fluent key parity across all 18 locales:

```sh
cargo run -p xtask -- i18n-lint
```

Run Criterion benches:

```sh
# Full-size run; several minutes on a normal SSD
cargo bench -p copythat-core --bench copy_bench

# CI-scaled run, finishes in ~60 s
cargo run -p xtask --release -- bench-ci

# Head-to-head against any competitor copiers on PATH
cargo run -p xtask --release -- bench-vs
```

Per-phase smoke tests (run them individually):

```sh
# Phase 0 — scaffold
bash tests/smoke/phase_00_scaffold.sh

# Phase 1 — 100 MiB async round-trip through copy_file
cargo test -p copythat-core --test phase_01_core_copy -- --nocapture

# Phase 2 — 500-file tree copy + move
cargo test -p copythat-core --test phase_02_tree_queue -- --nocapture

# Phase 3 — 500 MiB copy+verify across all 8 hash algorithms
cargo test -p copythat-hash --test phase_03_verify --release -- --nocapture

# Phase 4 — 10 MiB shred across every ShredMethod
cargo test -p copythat-secure-delete --test phase_04_shred -- --nocapture

# Phase 5 — Tauri shell end-to-end
pwsh tests/smoke/phase_05_ui.ps1     # Windows
bash tests/smoke/phase_05_ui.sh      # macOS / Linux

# Phase 6 — sparse-file round-trip through the platform fast paths
cargo test -p copythat-platform --test phase_06_fast_paths -- --nocapture

# Phase 13 — throughput floor (20 MiB/s on a 100 MiB single-file copy)
cargo test -p copythat-ui --test phase_13_bench -- --nocapture

# Phase 16 — free-first packaging tripwire (no paid signing, free runners only)
cargo test -p copythat-ui --test phase_16_package -- --nocapture

# Phase 17a — red-team `..` traversal rejection at every trust boundary
cargo test -p copythat-core --test phase_17_security -- --nocapture

# Phase 18 — end-to-end: seed → copy_tree(BLAKE3) → history → CSV → shred_tree
cargo test -p copythat-ui --test phase_18_e2e -- --nocapture
# Scale up the phase 18 run to the literal Phase 18 brief (10 000 files):
COPYTHAT_PHASE18_FULL=1 cargo test -p copythat-ui --test phase_18_e2e --release

# Phase 23 — 100 MiB sparse copy: byte-exact + dst allocated <= 8 MiB
cargo test -p copythat-platform --test phase_23_sparse -- --nocapture
```

## Installing

Installable artifacts for every supported platform are produced by a
tag-triggered workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) that runs
exclusively on free GitHub-hosted runners. Tag a commit with `v*.*.*`
and the release job uploads:

| Platform | Artifact                    | Install command / channel                                    |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Windows  | MSI + NSIS (`.exe`)          | Double-click, or `winget install CopyThat.CopyThat` (after the winget-pkgs PR merges) |
| macOS    | `.app` + `.dmg` (x64 + arm64)| Right-click → Open on first launch, or `brew install --cask copythat` |
| Linux    | AppImage + `.deb` + `.rpm`   | `sudo apt install ./copythat-ui_<ver>_amd64.deb`, or Flathub / AUR |

Everything above ships **without paying for code-signing**:

- Windows installers are unsigned. SmartScreen shows a one-time
  warning for the first ~100 downloads, then Microsoft's reputation
  service clears the binary. Winget's SHA-256 verification gives a
  tamper-proof install path in the meantime.
- macOS bundles are **ad-hoc signed** (`codesign -s -`). Gatekeeper
  asks you to right-click → Open on first launch; subsequent launches
  are silent. Homebrew cask auto-clears the quarantine flag.
- Linux artifacts are GPG-signed only if the maintainers have set the
  optional `GPG_SIGNING_KEY` repository secret; otherwise they ship
  unsigned and distros verify via the AppImage hash + apt/rpm trust.

The free-first guarantee is enforced by
[`tests/smoke/phase_16_package.rs`](tests/smoke/phase_16_package.rs),
which fails the build if the release workflow ever imports a
paid-signing service outside a commented-out upgrade block. The paid
upgrade paths (Azure Trusted Signing ~$10/mo, Apple Developer $99/yr,
MiniSign updater signing) are captured in a maintainer-local
`docs/SIGNING_UPGRADE.md` planning doc; the commented-out
`windows-sign:` and `macos-notarize:` job blocks at the bottom of
`.github/workflows/release.yml` mirror the exact wiring.
