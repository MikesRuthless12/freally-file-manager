//! Phase 31b smoke test — real OS power probes.
//!
//! Closes the deferred Phase 31b items by wiring real
//! `RealPresentationProbe` / `RealFullscreenProbe` types backed by
//! per-OS calls:
//!
//! - **Windows** — `SHQueryUserNotificationState` from Shell32 via
//!   `copythat_platform::presence`.
//! - **Linux** — `org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver.GetActive` over DBus
//!   via `zbus::blocking`.
//! - **macOS** — keeps the stub for now; the IOPMAssertion read
//!   needs a macOS dev box to confirm the assertion-name match.
//!
//! Coverage:
//! 1. `is_in_presentation_mode()` + `is_in_fullscreen_mode()` are
//!    callable on every host without panicking. CI runners have no
//!    GPU / no logged-in user / no DBus session — the answer is
//!    whatever the OS returns, but the call must succeed.
//! 2. `RealPresentationProbe` + `RealFullscreenProbe` types
//!    instantiate and impl the right traits on every supported OS.
//! 3. The runner's `PowerBus` accepts the real probes without
//!    panicking — same shape as the existing `SyntheticProbes`
//!    consumer.

// literal, so the probe-construction helpers below build the trait
