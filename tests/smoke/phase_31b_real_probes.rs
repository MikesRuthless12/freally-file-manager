//! Phase 31b smoke test — real OS power probes.
//!
//! Wires the real `RealPresentationProbe` / `RealFullscreenProbe`
//! types backed by per-OS calls:
//!
//! - **Windows** — `SHQueryUserNotificationState` from Shell32 via
//!   `freally_platform::presence` (presentation and fullscreen are
//!   distinct `QUNS_*` states).
//! - **Linux / macOS / other** — deferred to the cross-platform stub
//!   for now (`Real*Probe` are type aliases to the stub there). The
//!   Linux GNOME DBus probe was pulled — it blocked inside the tokio
//!   poller and over-fired on any idle-inhibit; a non-blocking rework
//!   validated on real Linux is a Phase 31c follow-up.
//!
//! Coverage:
//! 1. `is_in_presentation_mode()` + `is_in_fullscreen_mode()` are
//!    callable on every host without panicking. CI runners have no
//!    GPU / no logged-in user / no DBus session — the answer is
//!    whatever the OS returns, but the call must succeed.
//! 2. `RealPresentationProbe` + `RealFullscreenProbe` types
//!    instantiate and impl the right traits on every supported OS.
//! 3. The runner's `PowerBus` accepts the real probes without
//!    panicking — same shape as the existing `SyntheticProbes`
//!    consumer.
