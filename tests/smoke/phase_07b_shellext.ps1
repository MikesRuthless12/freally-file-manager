.SYNOPSIS
    Phase 7b smoke test -- Windows COM DLL layer.

.DESCRIPTION
    Verifies the compiled freally-shellext.dll is a valid COM
    in-proc server without actually registering it against a user
    profile. The test:

    1. Builds the DLL in release mode via `cargo build -p freally-shellext --release`.
    2. Resolves the produced DLL path.
    3. LoadLibraries the DLL via Win32 P/Invoke.
    4. Calls GetProcAddress for the four COM entry points
       regsvr32 + the COM runtime require:
           - DllGetClassObject
           - DllCanUnloadNow
           - DllRegisterServer
           - DllUnregisterServer
    5. FreeLibrary the DLL.
    6. Reports PASS / FAIL and exits with a matching code.

    No registry writes. No process spawns. No Explorer integration.
    The live end-to-end smoke (actually register the DLL, invoke
    "Copy with Freally File Manager" on a temp file via [Shell.Application],
    observe the running app enqueue the job) stays manual for 0.x
    because registering a COM DLL is an invasive operation and the
    CI Windows runner doesn't have a user-session Explorer to
    drive. When Phase 16 packaging wires up the MSI installer, the
    install-time hook exercises the live path.
